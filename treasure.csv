"123",120,"the beginning to the end, keeping nothing back but the bearings of the"
"124",120,"island, and that only because there is still treasure not yet lifted, I"
"125",120,"take up my pen in the year of grace 17__ and go back to the time when"
"126",120,"my father kept the Admiral Benbow inn and the brown old seaman with the"
"127",120,"sabre cut first took up his lodging under our roof."
"128",120,""
"129",120,"I remember him as if it were yesterday, as he came plodding to the"

"131",120,"tall, strong, heavy, nut-brown man, his tarry pigtail falling over the"
"132",120,"shoulder of his soiled blue coat, his hands ragged and scarred, with"
"133",120,"black, broken nails, and the sabre cut across one cheek, a dirty, livid"
"134",120,"white. I remember him looking round the cover and whistling to himself"
"135",120,"as he did so, and then breaking out in that old sea-song that he sang so"
"136",120,"often afterwards:"

"140",120,""
"141",120,"in the high, old tottering voice that seemed to have been tuned and"
"142",120,"broken at the capstan bars. Then he rapped on the door with a bit of"
"143",120,"stick like a handspike that he carried, and when my father appeared,"
"144",120,"called roughly for a glass of rum. This, when it was brought to him,"
"145",120,"he drank slowly, like a connoisseur, lingering on the taste and still"
"146",120,"looking about him at the cliffs and up at our signboard."
"147",120,""
"148",120,"""This is a handy cove,"" says he at length; ""and a pleasant sittyated"
"149",120,"grog-shop. Much company, mate?"""
"150",120,""
"151",120,"My father told him no, very little company, the more was the pity."
"152",120,""
"153",120,"""Well, then,"" said he, ""this is the berth for me. Here you, matey,"" he"
"154",120,"cried to the man who trundled the barrow; ""bring up alongside and help"
"155",120,"up my chest. I'll stay here a bit,"" he continued. ""I'm a plain man; rum"
"156",120,"and bacon and eggs is what I want, and that head up there for to watch"
"157",120,"ships off. What you mought call me? You mought call me captain. Oh, I"
"158",120,"see what you're at--there""; and he threw down three or four gold pieces"
"159",120,"on the threshold. ""You can tell me when I've worked through that,"" says"
"160",120,"he, looking as fierce as a commander."
"161",120,""
"162",120,"And indeed bad as his clothes were and coarsely as he spoke, he had none"
"163",120,"of the appearance of a man who sailed before the mast, but seemed like"
"164",120,"a mate or skipper accustomed to be obeyed or to strike. The man who came"
"165",120,"with the barrow told us the mail had set him down the morning before at"
"166",120,"the Royal George, that he had inquired what inns there were along the"
"167",120,"coast, and hearing ours well spoken of, I suppose, and described as"
"168",120,"lonely, had chosen it from the others for his place of residence. And"
"169",120,"that was all we could learn of our guest."
"170",120,""
"171",120,"He was a very silent man by custom. All day he hung round the cove or"
"172",120,"upon the cliffs with a brass telescope; all evening he sat in a corner"
"173",120,"of the parlour next the fire and drank rum and water very strong. Mostly"
"174",120,"he would not speak when spoken to, only look up sudden and fierce and"
"175",120,"blow through his nose like a fog-horn; and we and the people who came"
"176",120,"about our house soon learned to let him be. Every day when he came back"
"177",120,"from his stroll he would ask if any seafaring men had gone by along the"
"178",120,"road. At first we thought it was the want of company of his own kind"
"179",120,"that made him ask this question, but at last we began to see he was"
"180",120,"desirous to avoid them. When a seaman did put up at the Admiral Benbow"
"181",120,"(as now and then some did, making by the coast road for Bristol) he"
"182",120,"would look in at him through the curtained door before he entered the"
"183",120,"parlour; and he was always sure to be as silent as a mouse when any such"
"184",120,"was present. For me, at least, there was no secret about the matter, for"
"185",120,"I was, in a way, a sharer in his alarms. He had taken me aside one day"
"186",120,"and promised me a silver fourpenny on the first of every month if I"
"187",120,"would only keep my ""weather-eye open for a seafaring man with one leg"""
"188",120,"and let him know the moment he appeared. Often enough when the first"
"189",120,"of the month came round and I applied to him for my wage, he would only"
"190",120,"blow through his nose at me and stare me down, but before the week was"
"191",120,"out he was sure to think better of it, bring me my four-penny piece, and"
"192",120,"repeat his orders to look out for ""the seafaring man with one leg."""
"193",120,""
"194",120,"How that personage haunted my dreams, I need scarcely tell you. On"
"195",120,"stormy nights, when the wind shook the four corners of the house and"
"196",120,"the surf roared along the cove and up the cliffs, I would see him in a"
"197",120,"thousand forms, and with a thousand diabolical expressions. Now the leg"
"198",120,"would be cut off at the knee, now at the hip; now he was a monstrous"
"199",120,"kind of a creature who had never had but the one leg, and that in the"
"200",120,"middle of his body. To see him leap and run and pursue me over hedge and"
"201",120,"ditch was the worst of nightmares. And altogether I paid pretty dear for"
"202",120,"my monthly fourpenny piece, in the shape of these abominable fancies."
"203",120,""
"204",120,"But though I was so terrified by the idea of the seafaring man with one"
"205",120,"leg, I was far less afraid of the captain himself than anybody else who"
"206",120,"knew him. There were nights when he took a deal more rum and water"
"207",120,"than his head would carry; and then he would sometimes sit and sing his"
"208",120,"wicked, old, wild sea-songs, minding nobody; but sometimes he would call"
"209",120,"for glasses round and force all the trembling company to listen to his"
"210",120,"stories or bear a chorus to his singing. Often I have heard the house"
"211",120,"shaking with ""Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum,"" all the neighbours joining"
"212",120,"in for dear life, with the fear of death upon them, and each singing"
"213",120,"louder than the other to avoid remark. For in these fits he was the most"
"214",120,"overriding companion ever known; he would slap his hand on the table for"
"215",120,"silence all round; he would fly up in a passion of anger at a question,"
"216",120,"or sometimes because none was put, and so he judged the company was not"
"217",120,"following his story. Nor would he allow anyone to leave the inn till he"
"218",120,"had drunk himself sleepy and reeled off to bed."
"219",120,""
"220",120,"His stories were what frightened people worst of all. Dreadful stories"
"221",120,"they were--about hanging, and walking the plank, and storms at sea, and"
"222",120,"the Dry Tortugas, and wild deeds and places on the Spanish Main. By his"
"223",120,"own account he must have lived his life among some of the wickedest men"
"224",120,"that God ever allowed upon the sea, and the language in which he told"
"225",120,"these stories shocked our plain country people almost as much as the"
"226",120,"crimes that he described. My father was always saying the inn would be"
"227",120,"ruined, for people would soon cease coming there to be tyrannized over"
"228",120,"and put down, and sent shivering to their beds; but I really believe his"
"229",120,"presence did us good. People were frightened at the time, but on looking"
"230",120,"back they rather liked it; it was a fine excitement in a quiet country"
"231",120,"life, and there was even a party of the younger men who pretended to"
"232",120,"admire him, calling him a ""true sea-dog"" and a ""real old salt"" and"
"233",120,"such like names, and saying there was the sort of man that made England"
"234",120,"terrible at sea."
"235",120,""
"236",120,"In one way, indeed, he bade fair to ruin us, for he kept on staying week"
"237",120,"after week, and at last month after month, so that all the money had"
"238",120,"been long exhausted, and still my father never plucked up the heart to"
"239",120,"insist on having more. If ever he mentioned it, the captain blew through"
"240",120,"his nose so loudly that you might say he roared, and stared my poor"
"241",120,"father out of the room. I have seen him wringing his hands after such a"
"242",120,"rebuff, and I am sure the annoyance and the terror he lived in must have"
"243",120,"greatly hastened his early and unhappy death."
"244",120,""
"245",120,"All the time he lived with us the captain made no change whatever in his"
"246",120,"dress but to buy some stockings from a hawker. One of the cocks of his"
"247",120,"hat having fallen down, he let it hang from that day forth, though it"
"248",120,"was a great annoyance when it blew. I remember the appearance of his"
"249",120,"coat, which he patched himself upstairs in his room, and which, before"
"250",120,"the end, was nothing but patches. He never wrote or received a letter,"
"251",120,"and he never spoke with any but the neighbours, and with these, for the"
"252",120,"most part, only when drunk on rum. The great sea-chest none of us had"
"253",120,"ever seen open."
"254",120,""
"255",120,"He was only once crossed, and that was towards the end, when my poor"
"256",120,"father was far gone in a decline that took him off. Dr. Livesey came"
"257",120,"late one afternoon to see the patient, took a bit of dinner from my"
"258",120,"mother, and went into the parlour to smoke a pipe until his horse should"
"259",120,"come down from the hamlet, for we had no stabling at the old Benbow. I"
"260",120,"followed him in, and I remember observing the contrast the neat, bright"
"261",120,"doctor, with his powder as white as snow and his bright, black eyes and"
"262",120,"pleasant manners, made with the coltish country folk, and above all,"
"263",120,"with that filthy, heavy, bleared scarecrow of a pirate of ours, sitting,"
"264",120,"far gone in rum, with his arms on the table. Suddenly he--the captain,"
"265",120,"that is--began to pipe up his eternal song:"
"266",120,""
"267",120,"          ""Fifteen men on the dead man's chest--"
"268",120,"             Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!"
"269",120,"           Drink and the devil had done for the rest--"
"270",120,"             Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!"""
"271",120,""
"272",120,"At first I had supposed ""the dead man's chest"" to be that identical big"
"273",120,"box of his upstairs in the front room, and the thought had been mingled"
"274",120,"in my nightmares with that of the one-legged seafaring man. But by this"
"275",120,"time we had all long ceased to pay any particular notice to the song; it"
"276",120,"was new, that night, to nobody but Dr. Livesey, and on him I observed it"
"277",120,"did not produce an agreeable effect, for he looked up for a moment quite"
"278",120,"angrily before he went on with his talk to old Taylor, the gardener, on"
"279",120,"a new cure for the rheumatics. In the meantime, the captain gradually"
"280",120,"brightened up at his own music, and at last flapped his hand upon"
"281",120,"the table before him in a way we all knew to mean silence. The voices"
"282",120,"stopped at once, all but Dr. Livesey's; he went on as before speaking"
"283",120,"clear and kind and drawing briskly at his pipe between every word or"
"284",120,"two. The captain glared at him for a while, flapped his hand again,"
"285",120,"glared still harder, and at last broke out with a villainous, low oath,"
"286",120,"""Silence, there, between decks!"""
"287",120,""
"288",120,"""Were you addressing me, sir?"" says the doctor; and when the ruffian had"
"289",120,"told him, with another oath, that this was so, ""I have only one thing to"
"290",120,"say to you, sir,"" replies the doctor, ""that if you keep on drinking rum,"
"291",120,"the world will soon be quit of a very dirty scoundrel!"""
"292",120,""
"293",120,"The old fellow's fury was awful. He sprang to his feet, drew and opened"
"294",120,"a sailor's clasp-knife, and balancing it open on the palm of his hand,"
"295",120,"threatened to pin the doctor to the wall."
"296",120,""
"297",120,"The doctor never so much as moved. He spoke to him as before, over his"
"298",120,"shoulder and in the same tone of voice, rather high, so that all the"
"299",120,"room might hear, but perfectly calm and steady: ""If you do not put that"
"300",120,"knife this instant in your pocket, I promise, upon my honour, you shall"
"301",120,"hang at the next assizes."""
"302",120,""
"303",120,"Then followed a battle of looks between them, but the captain soon"
"304",120,"knuckled under, put up his weapon, and resumed his seat, grumbling like"
"305",120,"a beaten dog."
"306",120,""
"307",120,"""And now, sir,"" continued the doctor, ""since I now know there's such a"
"308",120,"fellow in my district, you may count I'll have an eye upon you day and"
"309",120,"night. I'm not a doctor only; I'm a magistrate; and if I catch a breath"
"310",120,"of complaint against you, if it's only for a piece of incivility like"
"311",120,"tonight's, I'll take effectual means to have you hunted down and routed"
"312",120,"out of this. Let that suffice."""
"313",120,""
"314",120,"Soon after, Dr. Livesey's horse came to the door and he rode away, but"
"315",120,"the captain held his peace that evening, and for many evenings to come."

"328",120,"frosts and heavy gales; and it was plain from the first that my poor"
"329",120,"father was little likely to see the spring. He sank daily, and my mother"
"330",120,"and I had all the inn upon our hands, and were kept busy enough without"
"331",120,"paying much regard to our unpleasant guest."
"332",120,""

"335",120,"the sun still low and only touching the hilltops and shining far to"
"336",120,"seaward. The captain had risen earlier than usual and set out down the"
"337",120,"beach, his cutlass swinging under the broad skirts of the old blue coat,"
"338",120,"his brass telescope under his arm, his hat tilted back upon his head. I"
"339",120,"remember his breath hanging like smoke in his wake as he strode off, and"
"340",120,"the last sound I heard of him as he turned the big rock was a loud snort"
"341",120,"of indignation, as though his mind was still running upon Dr. Livesey."
"342",120,""
"343",120,"Well, mother was upstairs with father and I was laying the"
"344",120,"breakfast-table against the captain's return when the parlour door"
"345",120,"opened and a man stepped in on whom I had never set my eyes before. He"
"346",120,"was a pale, tallowy creature, wanting two fingers of the left hand, and"
"347",120,"though he wore a cutlass, he did not look much like a fighter. I"
"348",120,"had always my eye open for seafaring men, with one leg or two, and I"
"349",120,"remember this one puzzled me. He was not sailorly, and yet he had a"
"350",120,"smack of the sea about him too."
"351",120,""
"352",120,"I asked him what was for his service, and he said he would take rum; but"
"353",120,"as I was going out of the room to fetch it, he sat down upon a table"
"354",120,"and motioned me to draw near. I paused where I was, with my napkin in my"
"355",120,"hand."
"356",120,""
"357",120,"""Come here, sonny,"" says he. ""Come nearer here."""
"358",120,""
"359",120,"I took a step nearer."

"361",120,"""Is this here table for my mate Bill?"" he asked with a kind of leer."
"362",120,""
"363",120,"I told him I did not know his mate Bill, and this was for a person who"
"364",120,"stayed in our house whom we called the captain."
"365",120,""
"366",120,"""Well,"" said he, ""my mate Bill would be called the captain, as like"
"367",120,"as not. He has a cut on one cheek and a mighty pleasant way with him,"
"368",120,"particularly in drink, has my mate Bill. We'll put it, for argument"
"369",120,"like, that your captain has a cut on one cheek--and we'll put it, if you"
"370",120,"like, that that cheek's the right one. Ah, well! I told you. Now, is my"
"371",120,"mate Bill in this here house?"""
"372",120,""

"374",120,""
"375",120,"""Which way, sonny? Which way is he gone?"""
"376",120,""
"377",120,"And when I had pointed out the rock and told him how the captain was"
"378",120,"likely to return, and how soon, and answered a few other questions,"
"379",120,"""Ah,"" said he, ""this'll be as good as drink to my mate Bill."""
"380",120,""
"381",120,"The expression of his face as he said these words was not at all"
"382",120,"pleasant, and I had my own reasons for thinking that the stranger was"
"383",120,"mistaken, even supposing he meant what he said. But it was no affair of"
"384",120,"mine, I thought; and besides, it was difficult to know what to do. The"
"385",120,"stranger kept hanging about just inside the inn door, peering round the"
"386",120,"corner like a cat waiting for a mouse. Once I stepped out myself into"
"387",120,"the road, but he immediately called me back, and as I did not obey quick"
"388",120,"enough for his fancy, a most horrible change came over his tallowy face,"
"389",120,"and he ordered me in with an oath that made me jump. As soon as I"
"390",120,"was back again he returned to his former manner, half fawning, half"
"391",120,"sneering, patted me on the shoulder, told me I was a good boy and he had"
"392",120,"taken quite a fancy to me. ""I have a son of my own,"" said he, ""as like"
"393",120,"you as two blocks, and he's all the pride of my 'art. But the great"
"394",120,"thing for boys is discipline, sonny--discipline. Now, if you had sailed"
"395",120,"along of Bill, you wouldn't have stood there to be spoke to twice--not"
"396",120,"you. That was never Bill's way, nor the way of sich as sailed with him."
"397",120,"And here, sure enough, is my mate Bill, with a spy-glass under his arm,"
"398",120,"bless his old 'art, to be sure. You and me'll just go back into the"
"399",120,"parlour, sonny, and get behind the door, and we'll give Bill a little"
"400",120,"surprise--bless his 'art, I say again."""
"401",120,""
"402",120,"So saying, the stranger backed along with me into the parlour and put me"
"403",120,"behind him in the corner so that we were both hidden by the open door. I"
"404",120,"was very uneasy and alarmed, as you may fancy, and it rather added to my"
"405",120,"fears to observe that the stranger was certainly frightened himself. He"
"406",120,"cleared the hilt of his cutlass and loosened the blade in the sheath;"
"407",120,"and all the time we were waiting there he kept swallowing as if he felt"
"408",120,"what we used to call a lump in the throat."
"409",120,""
"410",120,"At last in strode the captain, slammed the door behind him, without"
"411",120,"looking to the right or left, and marched straight across the room to"
"412",120,"where his breakfast awaited him."
"413",120,""
"414",120,"""Bill,"" said the stranger in a voice that I thought he had tried to make"
"415",120,"bold and big."
"416",120,""
"417",120,"The captain spun round on his heel and fronted us; all the brown had"
"418",120,"gone out of his face, and even his nose was blue; he had the look of a"
"419",120,"man who sees a ghost, or the evil one, or something worse, if anything"
"420",120,"can be; and upon my word, I felt sorry to see him all in a moment turn"
"421",120,"so old and sick."
"422",120,""
"423",120,"""Come, Bill, you know me; you know an old shipmate, Bill, surely,"" said"
"424",120,"the stranger."
"425",120,""
"426",120,"The captain made a sort of gasp."
"427",120,""
"428",120,"""Black Dog!"" said he."
"429",120,""
"430",120,"""And who else?"" returned the other, getting more at his ease. ""Black"
"431",120,"Dog as ever was, come for to see his old shipmate Billy, at the Admiral"
"432",120,"Benbow inn. Ah, Bill, Bill, we have seen a sight of times, us two, since"
"433",120,"I lost them two talons,"" holding up his mutilated hand."

"435",120,"""Now, look here,"" said the captain; ""you've run me down; here I am;"
"436",120,"well, then, speak up; what is it?"""
"437",120,""
"438",120,"""That's you, Bill,"" returned Black Dog, ""you're in the right of it,"
"439",120,"Billy. I'll have a glass of rum from this dear child here, as I've took"
"440",120,"such a liking to; and we'll sit down, if you please, and talk square,"
"441",120,"like old shipmates."""
"442",120,""
"443",120,"When I returned with the rum, they were already seated on either side"
"444",120,"of the captain's breakfast-table--Black Dog next to the door and"
"445",120,"sitting sideways so as to have one eye on his old shipmate and one, as I"
"446",120,"thought, on his retreat."
"447",120,""
"448",120,"He bade me go and leave the door wide open. ""None of your keyholes for"
"449",120,"me, sonny,"" he said; and I left them together and retired into the bar."
"450",120,""
"451",120,"For a long time, though I certainly did my best to listen, I could hear"
"452",120,"nothing but a low gattling; but at last the voices began to grow higher,"
"453",120,"and I could pick up a word or two, mostly oaths, from the captain."
"454",120,""
"455",120,"""No, no, no, no; and an end of it!"" he cried once. And again, ""If it"
"456",120,"comes to swinging, swing all, say I."""
"457",120,""
"458",120,"Then all of a sudden there was a tremendous explosion of oaths and"
"459",120,"other noises--the chair and table went over in a lump, a clash of steel"
"460",120,"followed, and then a cry of pain, and the next instant I saw Black"
"461",120,"Dog in full flight, and the captain hotly pursuing, both with drawn"
"462",120,"cutlasses, and the former streaming blood from the left shoulder. Just"
"463",120,"at the door the captain aimed at the fugitive one last tremendous"
"464",120,"cut, which would certainly have split him to the chine had it not been"
"465",120,"intercepted by our big signboard of Admiral Benbow. You may see the"
"466",120,"notch on the lower side of the frame to this day."
"467",120,""
"468",120,"That blow was the last of the battle. Once out upon the road, Black"
"469",120,"Dog, in spite of his wound, showed a wonderful clean pair of heels and"
"470",120,"disappeared over the edge of the hill in half a minute. The captain, for"
"471",120,"his part, stood staring at the signboard like a bewildered man. Then he"
"472",120,"passed his hand over his eyes several times and at last turned back into"
"473",120,"the house."
"474",120,""
"475",120,"""Jim,"" says he, ""rum""; and as he spoke, he reeled a little, and caught"
"476",120,"himself with one hand against the wall."
"477",120,""
"478",120,"""Are you hurt?"" cried I."
"479",120,""
"480",120,"""Rum,"" he repeated. ""I must get away from here. Rum! Rum!"""
"481",120,""
"482",120,"I ran to fetch it, but I was quite unsteadied by all that had fallen"
"483",120,"out, and I broke one glass and fouled the tap, and while I was still"
"484",120,"getting in my own way, I heard a loud fall in the parlour, and running"
"485",120,"in, beheld the captain lying full length upon the floor. At the same"
"486",120,"instant my mother, alarmed by the cries and fighting, came running"
"487",120,"downstairs to help me. Between us we raised his head. He was breathing"
"488",120,"very loud and hard, but his eyes were closed and his face a horrible"
"489",120,"colour."
"490",120,""
"491",120,"""Dear, deary me,"" cried my mother, ""what a disgrace upon the house! And"
"492",120,"your poor father sick!"""

"494",120,"In the meantime, we had no idea what to do to help the captain, nor any"
"495",120,"other thought but that he had got his death-hurt in the scuffle with"
"496",120,"the stranger. I got the rum, to be sure, and tried to put it down his"
"497",120,"throat, but his teeth were tightly shut and his jaws as strong as iron."
"498",120,"It was a happy relief for us when the door opened and Doctor Livesey"
"499",120,"came in, on his visit to my father."
"500",120,""
"501",120,"""Oh, doctor,"" we cried, ""what shall we do? Where is he wounded?"""
"502",120,""
"503",120,"""Wounded? A fiddle-stick's end!"" said the doctor. ""No more wounded than"

"507",120,"worthless life; Jim, you get me a basin."""
"508",120,""
"509",120,"When I got back with the basin, the doctor had already ripped up the"
"510",120,"captain's sleeve and exposed his great sinewy arm. It was tattooed"
"511",120,"in several places. ""Here's luck,"" ""A fair wind,"" and ""Billy Bones his"
"512",120,"fancy,"" were very neatly and clearly executed on the forearm; and up"
"513",120,"near the shoulder there was a sketch of a gallows and a man hanging from"

"515",120,""
"516",120,"""Prophetic,"" said the doctor, touching this picture with his finger."
"517",120,"""And now, Master Billy Bones, if that be your name, we'll have a look at"

"520",120,"""No, sir,"" said I."
"521",120,""
"522",120,"""Well, then,"" said he, ""you hold the basin""; and with that he took his"
"523",120,"lancet and opened a vein."

"525",120,"A great deal of blood was taken before the captain opened his eyes"
"526",120,"and looked mistily about him. First he recognized the doctor with"
"527",120,"an unmistakable frown; then his glance fell upon me, and he looked"
"528",120,"relieved. But suddenly his colour changed, and he tried to raise"
"529",120,"himself, crying, ""Where's Black Dog?"""
"530",120,""
"531",120,"""There is no Black Dog here,"" said the doctor, ""except what you have"

"533",120,"precisely as I told you; and I have just, very much against my own will,"
"534",120,"dragged you headforemost out of the grave. Now, Mr. Bones--"""

"653",120,"honour."""
"654",120,""
"655",120,"He wandered a little longer, his voice growing weaker; but soon after I"
"656",120,"had given him his medicine, which he took like a child, with the remark,"
"657",120,"""If ever a seaman wanted drugs, it's me,"" he fell at last into a heavy,"
"658",120,"swoon-like sleep, in which I left him. What I should have done had all"
"659",120,"gone well I do not know. Probably I should have told the whole story to"
"660",120,"the doctor, for I was in mortal fear lest the captain should repent of"
"661",120,"his confessions and make an end of me. But as things fell out, my poor"
"662",120,"father died quite suddenly that evening, which put all other matters"
"663",120,"on one side. Our natural distress, the visits of the neighbours, the"
"664",120,"arranging of the funeral, and all the work of the inn to be carried on"
"665",120,"in the meanwhile kept me so busy that I had scarcely time to think of"
"666",120,"the captain, far less to be afraid of him."
"667",120,""
"668",120,"He got downstairs next morning, to be sure, and had his meals as usual,"
"669",120,"though he ate little and had more, I am afraid, than his usual supply of"
"670",120,"rum, for he helped himself out of the bar, scowling and blowing through"
"671",120,"his nose, and no one dared to cross him. On the night before the funeral"
"672",120,"he was as drunk as ever; and it was shocking, in that house of mourning,"
"673",120,"to hear him singing away at his ugly old sea-song; but weak as he was,"
"674",120,"we were all in the fear of death for him, and the doctor was suddenly"
"675",120,"taken up with a case many miles away and was never near the house after"
"676",120,"my father's death. I have said the captain was weak, and indeed he"
"677",120,"seemed rather to grow weaker than regain his strength. He clambered up"
"678",120,"and down stairs, and went from the parlour to the bar and back again,"
"679",120,"and sometimes put his nose out of doors to smell the sea, holding on to"
"680",120,"the walls as he went for support and breathing hard and fast like a man"
"681",120,"on a steep mountain. He never particularly addressed me, and it is my"
"682",120,"belief he had as good as forgotten his confidences; but his temper was"
"683",120,"more flighty, and allowing for his bodily weakness, more violent than"
"684",120,"ever. He had an alarming way now when he was drunk of drawing his"
"685",120,"cutlass and laying it bare before him on the table. But with all that,"
"686",120,"he minded people less and seemed shut up in his own thoughts and rather"
"687",120,"wandering. Once, for instance, to our extreme wonder, he piped up to a"
"688",120,"different air, a kind of country love-song that he must have learned in"
"689",120,"his youth before he had begun to follow the sea."
"690",120,""
"691",120,"So things passed until, the day after the funeral, and about three"
"692",120,"o'clock of a bitter, foggy, frosty afternoon, I was standing at the door"
"693",120,"for a moment, full of sad thoughts about my father, when I saw someone"
"694",120,"drawing slowly near along the road. He was plainly blind, for he tapped"
"695",120,"before him with a stick and wore a great green shade over his eyes and"
"696",120,"nose; and he was hunched, as if with age or weakness, and wore a huge"
"697",120,"old tattered sea-cloak with a hood that made him appear positively"
"698",120,"deformed. I never saw in my life a more dreadful-looking figure."
"699",120,"He stopped a little from the inn, and raising his voice in an odd"
"700",120,"sing-song, addressed the air in front of him, ""Will any kind friend"
"701",120,"inform a poor blind man, who has lost the precious sight of his eyes in"
"702",120,"the gracious defence of his native country, England--and God bless King"
"703",120,"George!--where or in what part of this country he may now be?"""
"704",120,""
"705",120,"""You are at the Admiral Benbow, Black Hill Cove, my good man,"" said I."
"706",120,""
"707",120,"""I hear a voice,"" said he, ""a young voice. Will you give me your hand,"
"708",120,"my kind young friend, and lead me in?"""
"709",120,""
"710",120,"I held out my hand, and the horrible, soft-spoken, eyeless creature"
"711",120,"gripped it in a moment like a vise. I was so much startled that I"
"712",120,"struggled to withdraw, but the blind man pulled me close up to him with"
"713",120,"a single action of his arm."
"714",120,""
"715",120,"""Now, boy,"" he said, ""take me in to the captain."""
"716",120,""
"717",120,"""Sir,"" said I, ""upon my word I dare not."""
"718",120,""
"719",120,"""Oh,"" he sneered, ""that's it! Take me in straight or I'll break your"
"720",120,"arm."""
"721",120,""
"722",120,"And he gave it, as he spoke, a wrench that made me cry out."
"723",120,""
"724",120,"""Sir,"" said I, ""it is for yourself I mean. The captain is not what he"
"725",120,"used to be. He sits with a drawn cutlass. Another gentleman--"""
"726",120,""
"727",120,"""Come, now, march,"" interrupted he; and I never heard a voice so cruel,"
"728",120,"and cold, and ugly as that blind man's. It cowed me more than the pain,"
"729",120,"and I began to obey him at once, walking straight in at the door and"
"730",120,"towards the parlour, where our sick old buccaneer was sitting, dazed"
"731",120,"with rum. The blind man clung close to me, holding me in one iron fist"
"732",120,"and leaning almost more of his weight on me than I could carry. ""Lead me"
"733",120,"straight up to him, and when I'm in view, cry out, 'Here's a friend"
"734",120,"for you, Bill.' If you don't, I'll do this,"" and with that he gave me a"
"735",120,"twitch that I thought would have made me faint. Between this and that, I"
"736",120,"was so utterly terrified of the blind beggar that I forgot my terror of"
"737",120,"the captain, and as I opened the parlour door, cried out the words he"
"738",120,"had ordered in a trembling voice."
"739",120,""
"740",120,"The poor captain raised his eyes, and at one look the rum went out of"
"741",120,"him and left him staring sober. The expression of his face was not so"
"742",120,"much of terror as of mortal sickness. He made a movement to rise, but I"
"743",120,"do not believe he had enough force left in his body."
"744",120,""
"745",120,"""Now, Bill, sit where you are,"" said the beggar. ""If I can't see, I can"
"746",120,"hear a finger stirring. Business is business. Hold out your left hand."
"747",120,"Boy, take his left hand by the wrist and bring it near to my right."""
"748",120,""
"749",120,"We both obeyed him to the letter, and I saw him pass something from the"
"750",120,"hollow of the hand that held his stick into the palm of the captain's,"
"751",120,"which closed upon it instantly."
"752",120,""
"753",120,"""And now that's done,"" said the blind man; and at the words he suddenly"
"754",120,"left hold of me, and with incredible accuracy and nimbleness,"
"755",120,"skipped out of the parlour and into the road, where, as I still stood"
"756",120,"motionless, I could hear his stick go tap-tap-tapping into the distance."
"757",120,""
"758",120,"It was some time before either I or the captain seemed to gather our"
"759",120,"senses, but at length, and about at the same moment, I released his"
"760",120,"wrist, which I was still holding, and he drew in his hand and looked"
"761",120,"sharply into the palm."
"762",120,""
"763",120,"""Ten o'clock!"" he cried. ""Six hours. We'll do them yet,"" and he sprang"
"764",120,"to his feet."
"765",120,""
"766",120,"Even as he did so, he reeled, put his hand to his throat, stood swaying"
"767",120,"for a moment, and then, with a peculiar sound, fell from his whole"
"768",120,"height face foremost to the floor."
"769",120,""
"770",120,"I ran to him at once, calling to my mother. But haste was all in vain."
"771",120,"The captain had been struck dead by thundering apoplexy. It is a curious"
"772",120,"thing to understand, for I had certainly never liked the man, though of"
"773",120,"late I had begun to pity him, but as soon as I saw that he was dead, I"
"774",120,"burst into a flood of tears. It was the second death I had known, and"
"775",120,"the sorrow of the first was still fresh in my heart."
"776",120,""

"778",120,""

"781",120,""
"782",120,"The Sea-chest"
"783",120,""
"784",120,"I LOST no time, of course, in telling my mother all that I knew, and"
"785",120,"perhaps should have told her long before, and we saw ourselves at once"
"786",120,"in a difficult and dangerous position. Some of the man's money--if"
"787",120,"he had any--was certainly due to us, but it was not likely that our"
"788",120,"captain's shipmates, above all the two specimens seen by me, Black"
"789",120,"Dog and the blind beggar, would be inclined to give up their booty in"
"790",120,"payment of the dead man's debts. The captain's order to mount at"
"791",120,"once and ride for Doctor Livesey would have left my mother alone"
"792",120,"and unprotected, which was not to be thought of. Indeed, it seemed"
"793",120,"impossible for either of us to remain much longer in the house; the fall"
"794",120,"of coals in the kitchen grate, the very ticking of the clock, filled"
"795",120,"us with alarms. The neighbourhood, to our ears, seemed haunted by"
"796",120,"approaching footsteps; and what between the dead body of the captain"
"797",120,"on the parlour floor and the thought of that detestable blind beggar"
"798",120,"hovering near at hand and ready to return, there were moments when, as"
"799",120,"the saying goes, I jumped in my skin for terror. Something must speedily"
"800",120,"be resolved upon, and it occurred to us at last to go forth together"
"801",120,"and seek help in the neighbouring hamlet. No sooner said than done."
"802",120,"Bare-headed as we were, we ran out at once in the gathering evening and"
"803",120,"the frosty fog."
"804",120,""
"805",120,"The hamlet lay not many hundred yards away, though out of view, on the"
"806",120,"other side of the next cove; and what greatly encouraged me, it was"
"807",120,"in an opposite direction from that whence the blind man had made his"
"808",120,"appearance and whither he had presumably returned. We were not many"
"809",120,"minutes on the road, though we sometimes stopped to lay hold of each"
"810",120,"other and hearken. But there was no unusual sound--nothing but the low"
"811",120,"wash of the ripple and the croaking of the inmates of the wood."
"812",120,""
"813",120,"It was already candle-light when we reached the hamlet, and I shall"
"814",120,"never forget how much I was cheered to see the yellow shine in doors and"
"815",120,"windows; but that, as it proved, was the best of the help we were likely"
"816",120,"to get in that quarter. For--you would have thought men would have been"
"817",120,"ashamed of themselves--no soul would consent to return with us to the"
"818",120,"Admiral Benbow. The more we told of our troubles, the more--man, woman,"
"819",120,"and child--they clung to the shelter of their houses. The name of"
"820",120,"Captain Flint, though it was strange to me, was well enough known to"
"821",120,"some there and carried a great weight of terror. Some of the men who"
"822",120,"had been to field-work on the far side of the Admiral Benbow remembered,"
"823",120,"besides, to have seen several strangers on the road, and taking them to"
"824",120,"be smugglers, to have bolted away; and one at least had seen a little"
"825",120,"lugger in what we called Kitt's Hole. For that matter, anyone who was a"
"826",120,"comrade of the captain's was enough to frighten them to death. And the"
"827",120,"short and the long of the matter was, that while we could get several"
"828",120,"who were willing enough to ride to Dr. Livesey's, which lay in another"
"829",120,"direction, not one would help us to defend the inn."
"830",120,""
"831",120,"They say cowardice is infectious; but then argument is, on the other"
"832",120,"hand, a great emboldener; and so when each had said his say, my mother"

"834",120,"belonged to her fatherless boy; ""If none of the rest of you dare,"""
"835",120,"she said, ""Jim and I dare. Back we will go, the way we came, and small"

"840",120,"Of course I said I would go with my mother, and of course they all cried"
"841",120,"out at our foolhardiness, but even then not a man would go along with"
"842",120,"us. All they would do was to give me a loaded pistol lest we were"
"843",120,"attacked, and to promise to have horses ready saddled in case we were"
"844",120,"pursued on our return, while one lad was to ride forward to the doctor's"
"845",120,"in search of armed assistance."
"846",120,""
"847",120,"My heart was beating finely when we two set forth in the cold night upon"
"848",120,"this dangerous venture. A full moon was beginning to rise and peered"
"849",120,"redly through the upper edges of the fog, and this increased our haste,"
"850",120,"for it was plain, before we came forth again, that all would be as"
"851",120,"bright as day, and our departure exposed to the eyes of any watchers."
"852",120,"We slipped along the hedges, noiseless and swift, nor did we see or hear"
"853",120,"anything to increase our terrors, till, to our relief, the door of the"
"854",120,"Admiral Benbow had closed behind us."
"855",120,""
"856",120,"I slipped the bolt at once, and we stood and panted for a moment in the"
"857",120,"dark, alone in the house with the dead captain's body. Then my mother"
"858",120,"got a candle in the bar, and holding each other's hands, we advanced"
"859",120,"into the parlour. He lay as we had left him, on his back, with his eyes"

"864",120,"the key off THAT; and who's to touch it, I should like to know!"" and she"
"865",120,"gave a kind of sob as she said the words."
"866",120,""
"867",120,"I went down on my knees at once. On the floor close to his hand there"
"868",120,"was a little round of paper, blackened on the one side. I could not"
"869",120,"doubt that this was the BLACK SPOT; and taking it up, I found written"
"870",120,"on the other side, in a very good, clear hand, this short message: ""You"
"871",120,"have till ten tonight."""
"872",120,""
"873",120,"""He had till ten, Mother,"" said I; and just as I said it, our old clock"

"881",120,"at the end, his gully with the crooked handle, a pocket compass, and a"
"882",120,"tinder box were all that they contained, and I began to despair."

"902",120,"that, the miscellany began--a quadrant, a tin canikin, several sticks of"
"903",120,"tobacco, two brace of very handsome pistols, a piece of bar silver, an"
"904",120,"old Spanish watch and some other trinkets of little value and mostly of"
"905",120,"foreign make, a pair of compasses mounted with brass, and five or six"

"913",120,"mother pulled it up with impatience, and there lay before us, the last"
"914",120,"things in the chest, a bundle tied up in oilcloth, and looking like"

"977",120,"and fell on my shoulder. I do not know how I found the strength to do it"
"978",120,"at all, and I am afraid it was roughly done, but I managed to drag her"
"979",120,"down the bank and a little way under the arch. Farther I could not move"
"980",120,"her, for the bridge was too low to let me do more than crawl below it."
"981",120,"So there we had to stay--my mother almost entirely exposed and both of"
"982",120,"us within earshot of the inn."

"1024",120,"with a slam and a jingle of broken glass, and a man leaned out into the"
"1025",120,"moonlight, head and shoulders, and addressed the blind beggar on the"

"1041",120,"""Here, you below there, is it on Bill?"" cried the blind man again."
"1042",120,""
"1043",120,"At that another fellow, probably him who had remained below to search"

"1047",120,"""It's these people of the inn--it's that boy. I wish I had put his eyes"

"1059",120,"very rocks re-echoed and the men came out again, one after another, on"
"1060",120,"the road and declared that we were nowhere to be found. And just"
"1061",120,"the same whistle that had alarmed my mother and myself over the dead"
"1062",120,"captain's money was once more clearly audible through the night,"
"1063",120,"but this time twice repeated. I had thought it to be the blind man's"
"1064",120,"trumpet, so to speak, summoning his crew to the assault, but I now found"
"1065",120,"that it was a signal from the hillside towards the hamlet, and from its"
"1066",120,"effect upon the buccaneers, a signal to warn them of approaching danger."

"1101",120,""
"1102",120,"This quarrel was the saving of us, for while it was still raging,"
"1103",120,"another sound came from the top of the hill on the side of the"
"1104",120,"hamlet--the tramp of horses galloping. Almost at the same time a"
"1105",120,"pistol-shot, flash and report, came from the hedge side. And that was"
"1106",120,"plainly the last signal of danger, for the buccaneers turned at once"
"1107",120,"and ran, separating in every direction, one seaward along the cove, one"
"1108",120,"slant across the hill, and so on, so that in half a minute not a sign of"
"1109",120,"them remained but Pew. Him they had deserted, whether in sheer panic"
"1110",120,"or out of revenge for his ill words and blows I know not; but there he"
"1111",120,"remained behind, tapping up and down the road in a frenzy, and groping"
"1112",120,"and calling for his comrades. Finally he took a wrong turn and ran a few"
"1113",120,"steps past me, towards the hamlet, crying, ""Johnny, Black Dog, Dirk,"""
"1114",120,"and other names, ""you won't leave old Pew, mates--not old Pew!"""
"1115",120,""
"1116",120,"Just then the noise of horses topped the rise, and four or five riders"
"1117",120,"came in sight in the moonlight and swept at full gallop down the slope."

"1119",120,"At this Pew saw his error, turned with a scream, and ran straight for"
"1120",120,"the ditch, into which he rolled. But he was on his feet again in a"
"1121",120,"second and made another dash, now utterly bewildered, right under the"
"1122",120,"nearest of the coming horses."
"1123",120,""
"1124",120,"The rider tried to save him, but in vain. Down went Pew with a cry that"
"1125",120,"rang high into the night; and the four hoofs trampled and spurned him"
"1126",120,"and passed by. He fell on his side, then gently collapsed upon his face"
"1127",120,"and moved no more."
"1128",120,""
"1129",120,"I leaped to my feet and hailed the riders. They were pulling up, at any"
"1130",120,"rate, horrified at the accident; and I soon saw what they were. One,"
"1131",120,"tailing out behind the rest, was a lad that had gone from the hamlet to"
"1132",120,"Dr. Livesey's; the rest were revenue officers, whom he had met by the"
"1133",120,"way, and with whom he had had the intelligence to return at once. Some"
"1134",120,"news of the lugger in Kitt's Hole had found its way to Supervisor Dance"
"1135",120,"and set him forth that night in our direction, and to that circumstance"
"1136",120,"my mother and I owed our preservation from death."
"1137",120,""
"1138",120,"Pew was dead, stone dead. As for my mother, when we had carried her up"
"1139",120,"to the hamlet, a little cold water and salts and that soon brought her"
"1140",120,"back again, and she was none the worse for her terror, though she still"
"1141",120,"continued to deplore the balance of the money. In the meantime the"
"1142",120,"supervisor rode on, as fast as he could, to Kitt's Hole; but his men"
"1143",120,"had to dismount and grope down the dingle, leading, and sometimes"
"1144",120,"supporting, their horses, and in continual fear of ambushes; so it was"
"1145",120,"no great matter for surprise that when they got down to the Hole the"
"1146",120,"lugger was already under way, though still close in. He hailed her. A"
"1147",120,"voice replied, telling him to keep out of the moonlight or he would get"
"1148",120,"some lead in him, and at the same time a bullet whistled close by his"
"1149",120,"arm. Soon after, the lugger doubled the point and disappeared. Mr. Dance"
"1150",120,"stood there, as he said, ""like a fish out of water,"" and all he could do"
"1151",120,"was to dispatch a man to B---- to warn the cutter. ""And that,"" said he,"
"1152",120,"""is just about as good as nothing. They've got off clean, and there's"
"1153",120,"an end. Only,"" he added, ""I'm glad I trod on Master Pew's corns,"" for by"

"1156",120,"I went back with him to the Admiral Benbow, and you cannot imagine a"
"1157",120,"house in such a state of smash; the very clock had been thrown down"

"1159",120,"and though nothing had actually been taken away except the captain's"
"1160",120,"money-bag and a little silver from the till, I could see at once that we"

"1167",120,"have the thing in my breast pocket; and to tell you the truth, I should"
"1168",120,"like to get it put in safety."""

"1176",120,"well ride round there myself and report to him or squire. Master Pew's"
"1177",120,"dead, when all's done; not that I regret it, but he's dead, you see, and"

"1631",120,"were singing at their work, in another there were men aloft, high over"
"1632",120,"my head, hanging to threads that seemed no thicker than a spider's."
"1633",120,"Though I had lived by the shore all my life, I seemed never to have been"
"1634",120,"near the sea till then. The smell of tar and salt was something new."
"1635",120,"I saw the most wonderful figureheads, that had all been far over the"
"1636",120,"ocean. I saw, besides, many old sailors, with rings in their ears, and"
"1637",120,"whiskers curled in ringlets, and tarry pigtails, and their swaggering,"
"1638",120,"clumsy sea-walk; and if I had seen as many kings or archbishops I could"
"1639",120,"not have been more delighted."

"1644",120,""
"1645",120,"While I was still in this delightful dream, we came suddenly in front"
"1646",120,"of a large inn and met Squire Trelawney, all dressed out like a"

"1664",120,"WHEN I had done breakfasting the squire gave me a note addressed to John"
"1665",120,"Silver, at the sign of the Spy-glass, and told me I should easily"
"1666",120,"find the place by following the line of the docks and keeping a bright"
"1667",120,"lookout for a little tavern with a large brass telescope for sign. I"
"1668",120,"set off, overjoyed at this opportunity to see some more of the ships and"
"1669",120,"seamen, and picked my way among a great crowd of people and carts and"
"1670",120,"bales, for the dock was now at its busiest, until I found the tavern in"

"1672",120,""
"1673",120,"It was a bright enough little place of entertainment. The sign was"
"1674",120,"newly painted; the windows had neat red curtains; the floor was cleanly"
"1675",120,"sanded. There was a street on each side and an open door on both, which"
"1676",120,"made the large, low room pretty clear to see in, in spite of clouds of"
"1677",120,"tobacco smoke."
"1678",120,""
"1679",120,"The customers were mostly seafaring men, and they talked so loudly that"

"1682",120,"As I was waiting, a man came out of a side room, and at a glance I was"
"1683",120,"sure he must be Long John. His left leg was cut off close by the hip,"
"1684",120,"and under the left shoulder he carried a crutch, which he managed with"
"1685",120,"wonderful dexterity, hopping about upon it like a bird. He was very tall"
"1686",120,"and strong, with a face as big as a ham--plain and pale, but intelligent"
"1687",120,"and smiling. Indeed, he seemed in the most cheerful spirits, whistling"
"1688",120,"as he moved about among the tables, with a merry word or a slap on the"

"1693",120,"prove to be the very one-legged sailor whom I had watched for so long at"
"1694",120,"the old Benbow. But one look at the man before me was enough. I had seen"
"1695",120,"the captain, and Black Dog, and the blind man, Pew, and I thought I knew"
"1696",120,"what a buccaneer was like--a very different creature, according to me,"
"1697",120,"from this clean and pleasant-tempered landlord."
"1698",120,""
"1699",120,"I plucked up courage at once, crossed the threshold, and walked right up"

"1716",120,"glance. It was the tallow-faced man, wanting two fingers, who had come"

"1740",120,"""Now, Morgan,"" said Long John very sternly, ""you never clapped your eyes"
"1741",120,"on that Black--Black Dog before, did you, now?"""

"1743",120,"""Not I, sir,"" said Morgan with a salute."

"1749",120,"""By the powers, Tom Morgan, it's as good for you!"" exclaimed the"
"1750",120,"landlord. ""If you had been mixed up with the like of that, you would"
"1751",120,"never have put another foot in my house, you may lay to that. And what"
"1752",120,"was he saying to you?"""
"1753",120,""
"1754",120,"""I don't rightly know, sir,"" answered Morgan."

"1756",120,"""Do you call that a head on your shoulders, or a blessed dead-eye?"""
"1757",120,"cried Long John. ""Don't rightly know, don't you! Perhaps you don't"
"1758",120,"happen to rightly know who you was speaking to, perhaps? Come, now, what"

"1764",120,"lay to that. Get back to your place for a lubber, Tom."""
"1765",120,""
"1766",120,"And then, as Morgan rolled back to his seat, Silver added to me in a"
"1767",120,"confidential whisper that was very flattering, as I thought, ""He's"
"1768",120,"quite an honest man, Tom Morgan, on'y stupid. And now,"" he ran on again,"
"1769",120,"aloud, ""let's see--Black Dog? No, I don't know the name, not I. Yet I"

"1777",120,"certain. Ah, he looked a shark, he did! If we run down this Black Dog,"
"1778",120,"now, there'll be news for Cap'n Trelawney! Ben's a good runner; few"
"1779",120,"seamen run better than Ben. He should run him down, hand over hand, by"

"1784",120,"such a show of excitement as would have convinced an Old Bailey judge"
"1785",120,"or a Bow Street runner. My suspicions had been thoroughly reawakened on"
"1786",120,"finding Black Dog at the Spy-glass, and I watched the cook narrowly. But"
"1787",120,"he was too deep, and too ready, and too clever for me, and by the time"
"1788",120,"the two men had come back out of breath and confessed that they had lost"
"1789",120,"the track in a crowd, and been scolded like thieves, I would have gone"
"1790",120,"bail for the innocence of Long John Silver."
"1791",120,""

"2123",120,"shipping to flit by on either side; and before I could lie down to"
"2124",120,"snatch an hour of slumber the HISPANIOLA had begun her voyage to the"

"2132",120,""
"2133",120,"Mr. Arrow, first of all, turned out even worse than the captain had"

"2136",120,"day or two at sea he began to appear on deck with hazy eye, red cheeks,"
"2137",120,"stuttering tongue, and other marks of drunkenness. Time after time"
"2138",120,"he was ordered below in disgrace. Sometimes he fell and cut himself;"
"2139",120,"sometimes he lay all day long in his little bunk at one side of the"

"2156",120,""
"2157",120,"But there we were, without a mate; and it was necessary, of course, to"
"2158",120,"advance one of the men. The boatswain, Job Anderson, was the likeliest"
"2159",120,"man aboard, and though he kept his old title, he served in a way as"
"2160",120,"mate. Mr. Trelawney had followed the sea, and his knowledge made him"
"2161",120,"very useful, for he often took a watch himself in easy weather. And the"
"2162",120,"coxswain, Israel Hands, was a careful, wily, old, experienced seaman who"
"2163",120,"could be trusted at a pinch with almost anything."
"2164",120,""
"2165",120,"He was a great confidant of Long John Silver, and so the mention of"

"2168",120,""
"2169",120,"Aboard ship he carried his crutch by a lanyard round his neck, to have"

"2172",120,"to every movement of the ship, get on with his cooking like someone safe"
"2173",120,"ashore. Still more strange was it to see him in the heaviest of weather"
"2174",120,"cross the deck. He had a line or two rigged up to help him across the"
"2175",120,"widest spaces--Long John's earrings, they were called; and he would hand"
"2176",120,"himself from one place to another, now using the crutch, now trailing it"
"2177",120,"alongside by the lanyard, as quickly as another man could walk. Yet some"
"2178",120,"of the men who had sailed with him before expressed their pity to see"
"2179",120,"him so reduced."
"2180",120,""
"2181",120,"""He's no common man, Barbecue,"" said the coxswain to me. ""He had good"

"2184",120,"four and knock their heads together--him unarmed."""
"2185",120,""
"2186",120,"All the crew respected and even obeyed him. He had a way of talking"

"2215",120,"""Ah, she's a handsome craft, she is,"" the cook would say, and give her"
"2216",120,"sugar from his pocket, and then the bird would peck at the bars and"
"2217",120,"swear straight on, passing belief for wickedness. ""There,"" John would"

"2227",120,"but when he was spoken to, and then sharp and short and dry, and not a"
"2228",120,"word wasted. He owned, when driven into a corner, that he seemed to have"
"2229",120,"been wrong about the crew, that some of them were as brisk as he wanted"
"2230",120,"to see and all had behaved fairly well. As for the ship, he had taken a"

"2729",120,"made a great deal of way during the night and were now lying becalmed"
"2730",120,"about half a mile to the south-east of the low eastern coast."
"2731",120,"Grey-coloured woods covered a large part of the surface. This even tint"
"2732",120,"was indeed broken up by streaks of yellow sand-break in the lower lands,"
"2733",120,"and by many tall trees of the pine family, out-topping the others--some"
"2734",120,"singly, some in clumps; but the general colouring was uniform and sad."
"2735",120,"The hills ran up clear above the vegetation in spires of naked rock."
"2736",120,"All were strangely shaped, and the Spy-glass, which was by three or four"
"2737",120,"hundred feet the tallest on the island, was likewise the strangest in"
"2738",120,"configuration, running up sheer from almost every side and then suddenly"
"2739",120,"cut off at the top like a pedestal to put a statue on."
"2740",120,""
"2741",120,"The HISPANIOLA was rolling scuppers under in the ocean swell. The booms"
"2742",120,"were tearing at the blocks, the rudder was banging to and fro, and the"
"2743",120,"whole ship creaking, groaning, and jumping like a manufactory. I had"
"2744",120,"to cling tight to the backstay, and the world turned giddily before my"
"2745",120,"eyes, for though I was a good enough sailor when there was way on, this"
"2746",120,"standing still and being rolled about like a bottle was a thing I never"
"2747",120,"learned to stand without a qualm or so, above all in the morning, on an"
"2748",120,"empty stomach."
"2749",120,""
"2750",120,"Perhaps it was this--perhaps it was the look of the island, with its"
"2751",120,"grey, melancholy woods, and wild stone spires, and the surf that we"
"2752",120,"could both see and hear foaming and thundering on the steep beach--at"
"2753",120,"least, although the sun shone bright and hot, and the shore birds were"
"2754",120,"fishing and crying all around us, and you would have thought anyone"
"2755",120,"would have been glad to get to land after being so long at sea, my heart"
"2756",120,"sank, as the saying is, into my boots; and from the first look onward, I"
"2757",120,"hated the very thought of Treasure Island."
"2758",120,""
"2759",120,"We had a dreary morning's work before us, for there was no sign of any"
"2760",120,"wind, and the boats had to be got out and manned, and the ship warped"
"2761",120,"three or four miles round the corner of the island and up the narrow"
"2762",120,"passage to the haven behind Skeleton Island. I volunteered for one of"
"2763",120,"the boats, where I had, of course, no business. The heat was sweltering,"
"2764",120,"and the men grumbled fiercely over their work. Anderson was in command"

"2783",120,"a mile from each shore, the mainland on one side and Skeleton Island on"
"2784",120,"the other. The bottom was clean sand. The plunge of our anchor sent up"
"2785",120,"clouds of birds wheeling and crying over the woods, but in less than a"

"2791",120,"there. Two little rivers, or rather two swamps, emptied out into this"
"2792",120,"pond, as you might call it; and the foliage round that part of the shore"
"2793",120,"had a kind of poisonous brightness. From the ship we could see nothing"
"2794",120,"of the house or stockade, for they were quite buried among trees; and if"

"2802",120,"sodden leaves and rotting tree trunks. I observed the doctor sniffing"

"2811",120,"grudgingly and carelessly obeyed. Even the honest hands must have caught"
"2812",120,"the infection, for there was not one man aboard to mend another. Mutiny,"

"2818",120,"fairly outstripped himself in willingness and civility; he was all"
"2819",120,"smiles to everyone. If an order were given, John would be on his crutch"
"2820",120,"in an instant, with the cheeriest ""Aye, aye, sir!"" in the world; and"

"2840",120,"Let's allow the men an afternoon ashore. If they all go, why we'll fight"

"2860",120,""
"2861",120,"The captain was too bright to be in the way. He whipped out of sight"
"2862",120,"in a moment, leaving Silver to arrange the party, and I fancy it was as"
"2863",120,"well he did so. Had he been on deck, he could no longer so much as"
"2864",120,"have pretended not to understand the situation. It was as plain as day."
"2865",120,"Silver was the captain, and a mighty rebellious crew he had of it. The"
"2866",120,"honest hands--and I was soon to see it proved that there were such on"
"2867",120,"board--must have been very stupid fellows. Or rather, I suppose the"
"2868",120,"truth was this, that all hands were disaffected by the example of the"
"2869",120,"ringleaders--only some more, some less; and a few, being good fellows in"
"2870",120,"the main, could neither be led nor driven any further. It is one thing"

"2877",120,"Then it was that there came into my head the first of the mad notions"

"2928",120,"rattle."
"2929",120,""
"2930",120,"Then I came to a long thicket of these oaklike trees--live, or"
"2931",120,"evergreen, oaks, I heard afterwards they should be called--which grew"
"2932",120,"low along the sand like brambles, the boughs curiously twisted, the"
"2933",120,"foliage compact, like thatch. The thicket stretched down from the top of"
"2934",120,"one of the sandy knolls, spreading and growing taller as it went, until"
"2935",120,"it reached the margin of the broad, reedy fen, through which the nearest"
"2936",120,"of the little rivers soaked its way into the anchorage. The marsh was"
"2937",120,"steaming in the strong sun, and the outline of the Spy-glass trembled"
"2938",120,"through the haze."
"2939",120,""
"2940",120,"All at once there began to go a sort of bustle among the bulrushes;"
"2941",120,"a wild duck flew up with a quack, another followed, and soon over the"
"2942",120,"whole surface of the marsh a great cloud of birds hung screaming and"
"2943",120,"circling in the air. I judged at once that some of my shipmates must be"
"2944",120,"drawing near along the borders of the fen. Nor was I deceived, for soon"
"2945",120,"I heard the very distant and low tones of a human voice, which, as I"
"2946",120,"continued to give ear, grew steadily louder and nearer."
"2947",120,""
"2948",120,"This put me in a great fear, and I crawled under cover of the nearest"
"2949",120,"live-oak and squatted there, hearkening, as silent as a mouse."
"2950",120,""
"2951",120,"Another voice answered, and then the first voice, which I now recognized"
"2952",120,"to be Silver's, once more took up the story and ran on for a long while"
"2953",120,"in a stream, only now and again interrupted by the other. By the sound"
"2954",120,"they must have been talking earnestly, and almost fiercely; but no"
"2955",120,"distinct word came to my hearing."
"2956",120,""
"2957",120,"At last the speakers seemed to have paused and perhaps to have sat down,"
"2958",120,"for not only did they cease to draw any nearer, but the birds themselves"
"2959",120,"began to grow more quiet and to settle again to their places in the"
"2960",120,"swamp."
"2961",120,""
"2962",120,"And now I began to feel that I was neglecting my business, that since"
"2963",120,"I had been so foolhardy as to come ashore with these desperadoes, the"
"2964",120,"least I could do was to overhear them at their councils, and that my"
"2965",120,"plain and obvious duty was to draw as close as I could manage, under the"
"2966",120,"favourable ambush of the crouching trees."
"2967",120,""
"2968",120,"I could tell the direction of the speakers pretty exactly, not only by"
"2969",120,"the sound of their voices but by the behaviour of the few birds that"
"2970",120,"still hung in alarm above the heads of the intruders."
"2971",120,""
"2972",120,"Crawling on all fours, I made steadily but slowly towards them, till at"
"2973",120,"last, raising my head to an aperture among the leaves, I could see clear"
"2974",120,"down into a little green dell beside the marsh, and closely set about"
"2975",120,"with trees, where Long John Silver and another of the crew stood face to"
"2976",120,"face in conversation."
"2977",120,""
"2978",120,"The sun beat full upon them. Silver had thrown his hat beside him on the"
"2979",120,"ground, and his great, smooth, blond face, all shining with heat, was"
"2980",120,"lifted to the other man's in a kind of appeal."
"2981",120,""
"2982",120,"""Mate,"" he was saying, ""it's because I thinks gold dust of you--gold"
"2983",120,"dust, and you may lay to that! If I hadn't took to you like pitch, do"
"2984",120,"you think I'd have been here a-warning of you? All's up--you can't make"
"2985",120,"nor mend; it's to save your neck that I'm a-speaking, and if one of the"
"2986",120,"wild uns knew it, where'd I be, Tom--now, tell me, where'd I be?"""
"2987",120,""
"2988",120,"""Silver,"" said the other man--and I observed he was not only red in the"
"2989",120,"face, but spoke as hoarse as a crow, and his voice shook too, like a"
"2990",120,"taut rope--""Silver,"" says he, ""you're old, and you're honest, or has the"
"2991",120,"name for it; and you've money too, which lots of poor sailors hasn't;"
"2992",120,"and you're brave, or I'm mistook. And will you tell me you'll let"
"2993",120,"yourself be led away with that kind of a mess of swabs? Not you! As sure"
"2994",120,"as God sees me, I'd sooner lose my hand. If I turn agin my dooty--"""
"2995",120,""
"2996",120,"And then all of a sudden he was interrupted by a noise. I had found"
"2997",120,"one of the honest hands--well, here, at that same moment, came news of"
"2998",120,"another. Far away out in the marsh there arose, all of a sudden, a sound"
"2999",120,"like the cry of anger, then another on the back of it; and then one"
"3000",120,"horrid, long-drawn scream. The rocks of the Spy-glass re-echoed it a"
"3001",120,"score of times; the whole troop of marsh-birds rose again, darkening"
"3002",120,"heaven, with a simultaneous whirr; and long after that death yell was"
"3003",120,"still ringing in my brain, silence had re-established its empire, and"
"3004",120,"only the rustle of the redescending birds and the boom of the distant"
"3005",120,"surges disturbed the languor of the afternoon."
"3006",120,""
"3007",120,"Tom had leaped at the sound, like a horse at the spur, but Silver had"
"3008",120,"not winked an eye. He stood where he was, resting lightly on his crutch,"
"3009",120,"watching his companion like a snake about to spring."
"3010",120,""
"3011",120,"""John!"" said the sailor, stretching out his hand."
"3012",120,""
"3013",120,"""Hands off!"" cried Silver, leaping back a yard, as it seemed to me, with"
"3014",120,"the speed and security of a trained gymnast."
"3015",120,""
"3016",120,"""Hands off, if you like, John Silver,"" said the other. ""It's a black"
"3017",120,"conscience that can make you feared of me. But in heaven's name, tell"
"3018",120,"me, what was that?"""
"3019",120,""
"3020",120,"""That?"" returned Silver, smiling away, but warier than ever, his eye"
"3021",120,"a mere pin-point in his big face, but gleaming like a crumb of glass."
"3022",120,"""That? Oh, I reckon that'll be Alan."""
"3023",120,""
"3024",120,"And at this point Tom flashed out like a hero."
"3025",120,""
"3026",120,"""Alan!"" he cried. ""Then rest his soul for a true seaman! And as for you,"
"3027",120,"John Silver, long you've been a mate of mine, but you're mate of mine"
"3028",120,"no more. If I die like a dog, I'll die in my dooty. You've killed Alan,"
"3029",120,"have you? Kill me too, if you can. But I defies you."""
"3030",120,""
"3031",120,"And with that, this brave fellow turned his back directly on the cook"
"3032",120,"and set off walking for the beach. But he was not destined to go far."
"3033",120,"With a cry John seized the branch of a tree, whipped the crutch out of"
"3034",120,"his armpit, and sent that uncouth missile hurtling through the air."
"3035",120,"It struck poor Tom, point foremost, and with stunning violence, right"
"3036",120,"between the shoulders in the middle of his back. His hands flew up, he"
"3037",120,"gave a sort of gasp, and fell."
"3038",120,""
"3039",120,"Whether he were injured much or little, none could ever tell. Like"
"3040",120,"enough, to judge from the sound, his back was broken on the spot. But he"
"3041",120,"had no time given him to recover. Silver, agile as a monkey even without"
"3042",120,"leg or crutch, was on the top of him next moment and had twice buried"
"3043",120,"his knife up to the hilt in that defenceless body. From my place of"
"3044",120,"ambush, I could hear him pant aloud as he struck the blows."
"3045",120,""
"3046",120,"I do not know what it rightly is to faint, but I do know that for the"
"3047",120,"next little while the whole world swam away from before me in a whirling"
"3048",120,"mist; Silver and the birds, and the tall Spy-glass hilltop, going"
"3049",120,"round and round and topsy-turvy before my eyes, and all manner of bells"
"3050",120,"ringing and distant voices shouting in my ear."
"3051",120,""
"3052",120,"When I came again to myself the monster had pulled himself together,"
"3053",120,"his crutch under his arm, his hat upon his head. Just before him Tom"
"3054",120,"lay motionless upon the sward; but the murderer minded him not a whit,"
"3055",120,"cleansing his blood-stained knife the while upon a wisp of grass."
"3056",120,"Everything else was unchanged, the sun still shining mercilessly on the"
"3057",120,"steaming marsh and the tall pinnacle of the mountain, and I could scarce"
"3058",120,"persuade myself that murder had been actually done and a human life"
"3059",120,"cruelly cut short a moment since before my eyes."
"3060",120,""
"3061",120,"But now John put his hand into his pocket, brought out a whistle, and"
"3062",120,"blew upon it several modulated blasts that rang far across the heated"
"3063",120,"air. I could not tell, of course, the meaning of the signal, but"
"3064",120,"it instantly awoke my fears. More men would be coming. I might be"
"3065",120,"discovered. They had already slain two of the honest people; after Tom"
"3066",120,"and Alan, might not I come next?"
"3067",120,""
"3068",120,"Instantly I began to extricate myself and crawl back again, with what"
"3069",120,"speed and silence I could manage, to the more open portion of the"
"3070",120,"wood. As I did so, I could hear hails coming and going between the old"
"3071",120,"buccaneer and his comrades, and this sound of danger lent me wings. As"
"3072",120,"soon as I was clear of the thicket, I ran as I never ran before, scarce"
"3073",120,"minding the direction of my flight, so long as it led me from the"
"3074",120,"murderers; and as I ran, fear grew and grew upon me until it turned into"
"3075",120,"a kind of frenzy."
"3076",120,""
"3077",120,"Indeed, could anyone be more entirely lost than I? When the gun fired,"
"3078",120,"how should I dare to go down to the boats among those fiends, still"
"3079",120,"smoking from their crime? Would not the first of them who saw me wring"
"3080",120,"my neck like a snipe's? Would not my absence itself be an evidence to"
"3081",120,"them of my alarm, and therefore of my fatal knowledge? It was all over,"
"3082",120,"I thought. Good-bye to the HISPANIOLA; good-bye to the squire, the"
"3083",120,"doctor, and the captain! There was nothing left for me but death by"
"3084",120,"starvation or death by the hands of the mutineers."
"3085",120,""
"3086",120,"All this while, as I say, I was still running, and without taking any"
"3087",120,"notice, I had drawn near to the foot of the little hill with the two"
"3088",120,"peaks and had got into a part of the island where the live-oaks grew"
"3089",120,"more widely apart and seemed more like forest trees in their bearing and"
"3090",120,"dimensions. Mingled with these were a few scattered pines, some fifty,"
"3091",120,"some nearer seventy, feet high. The air too smelt more freshly than down"
"3092",120,"beside the marsh."
"3093",120,""

"3103",120,"FROM the side of the hill, which was here steep and stony, a spout of"
"3104",120,"gravel was dislodged and fell rattling and bounding through the trees."
"3105",120,"My eyes turned instinctively in that direction, and I saw a figure leap"
"3106",120,"with great rapidity behind the trunk of a pine. What it was, whether"
"3107",120,"bear or man or monkey, I could in no wise tell. It seemed dark and"
"3108",120,"shaggy; more I knew not. But the terror of this new apparition brought"
"3109",120,"me to a stand."
"3110",120,""
"3111",120,"I was now, it seemed, cut off upon both sides; behind me the murderers,"
"3112",120,"before me this lurking nondescript. And immediately I began to prefer"
"3113",120,"the dangers that I knew to those I knew not. Silver himself appeared"
"3114",120,"less terrible in contrast with this creature of the woods, and I turned"
"3115",120,"on my heel, and looking sharply behind me over my shoulder, began to"
"3116",120,"retrace my steps in the direction of the boats."
"3117",120,""
"3118",120,"Instantly the figure reappeared, and making a wide circuit, began to"
"3119",120,"head me off. I was tired, at any rate; but had I been as fresh as when I"
"3120",120,"rose, I could see it was in vain for me to contend in speed with such an"
"3121",120,"adversary. From trunk to trunk the creature flitted like a deer, running"
"3122",120,"manlike on two legs, but unlike any man that I had ever seen, stooping"
"3123",120,"almost double as it ran. Yet a man it was, I could no longer be in doubt"

"3128",120,"had somewhat reassured me, and my fear of Silver began to revive in"
"3129",120,"proportion. I stood still, therefore, and cast about for some method of"
"3130",120,"escape; and as I was so thinking, the recollection of my pistol flashed"
"3131",120,"into my mind. As soon as I remembered I was not defenceless, courage"
"3132",120,"glowed again in my heart and I set my face resolutely for this man of"

"3138",120,"drew back, came forward again, and at last, to my wonder and"
"3139",120,"confusion, threw himself on his knees and held out his clasped hands in"

"3153",120,"quite startling in so dark a face. Of all the beggar-men that I had seen"

"3253",120,"ain't you? Well, you just put your trust in Ben Gunn--Ben Gunn's the man"
"3254",120,"to do it. Would you think it likely, now, that your squire would prove"
"3255",120,"a liberal-minded one in case of help--him being in a clove hitch, as you"

"3274",120,"""Now, I'll tell you what,"" he went on. ""So much I'll tell you, and no"
"3275",120,"more. I were in Flint's ship when he buried the treasure; he and"
"3276",120,"six along--six strong seamen. They was ashore nigh on a week, and us"
"3277",120,"standing off and on in the old WALRUS. One fine day up went the signal,"
"3278",120,"and here come Flint by himself in a little boat, and his head done up in"
"3279",120,"a blue scarf. The sun was getting up, and mortal white he looked about"
"3280",120,"the cutwater. But, there he was, you mind, and the six all dead--dead"
"3281",120,"and buried. How he done it, not a man aboard us could make out. It was"
"3282",120,"battle, murder, and sudden death, leastways--him against six. Billy"
"3283",120,"Bones was the mate; Long John, he was quartermaster; and they asked him"
"3284",120,"where the treasure was. 'Ah,' says he, 'you can go ashore, if you like,"
"3285",120,"and stay,' he says; 'but as for the ship, she'll beat up for more, by"
"3286",120,"thunder!' That's what he said."
"3287",120,""
"3288",120,"""Well, I was in another ship three years back, and we sighted this"
"3289",120,"island. 'Boys,' said I, 'here's Flint's treasure; let's land and find"
"3290",120,"it.' The cap'n was displeased at that, but my messmates were all of a"
"3291",120,"mind and landed. Twelve days they looked for it, and every day they had"
"3292",120,"the worse word for me, until one fine morning all hands went aboard. 'As"
"3293",120,"for you, Benjamin Gunn,' says they, 'here's a musket,' they says, 'and"
"3294",120,"a spade, and pick-axe. You can stay here and find Flint's money for"

"3307",120,"think upon a prayer (says you), and sometimes he would maybe think of"
"3308",120,"his old mother, so be as she's alive (you'll say); but the most part"
"3309",120,"of Gunn's time (this is what you'll say)--the most part of his time was"

"3367",120,"IT was about half past one--three bells in the sea phrase--that the two"
"3368",120,"boats went ashore from the HISPANIOLA. The captain, the squire, and I"

"3370",120,"we should have fallen on the six mutineers who were left aboard with"

"3372",120,"to complete our helplessness, down came Hunter with the news that Jim"
"3373",120,"Hawkins had slipped into a boat and was gone ashore with the rest."
"3374",120,""
"3375",120,"It never occurred to us to doubt Jim Hawkins, but we were alarmed for"
"3376",120,"his safety. With the men in the temper they were in, it seemed an even"
"3377",120,"chance if we should see the lad again. We ran on deck. The pitch was"
"3378",120,"bubbling in the seams; the nasty stench of the place turned me sick;"
"3379",120,"if ever a man smelt fever and dysentery, it was in that abominable"
"3380",120,"anchorage. The six scoundrels were sitting grumbling under a sail in the"
"3381",120,"forecastle; ashore we could see the gigs made fast and a man sitting"
"3382",120,"in each, hard by where the river runs in. One of them was whistling"
"3383",120,"""Lillibullero."""
"3384",120,""
"3385",120,"Waiting was a strain, and it was decided that Hunter and I should go"
"3386",120,"ashore with the jolly-boat in quest of information."
"3387",120,""
"3388",120,"The gigs had leaned to their right, but Hunter and I pulled straight in,"
"3389",120,"in the direction of the stockade upon the chart. The two who were"
"3390",120,"left guarding their boats seemed in a bustle at our appearance;"
"3391",120,"""Lillibullero"" stopped off, and I could see the pair discussing what"
"3392",120,"they ought to do. Had they gone and told Silver, all might have turned"
"3393",120,"out differently; but they had their orders, I suppose, and decided to"
"3394",120,"sit quietly where they were and hark back again to ""Lillibullero."""
"3395",120,""
"3396",120,"There was a slight bend in the coast, and I steered so as to put it"
"3397",120,"between us; even before we landed we had thus lost sight of the gigs."
"3398",120,"I jumped out and came as near running as I durst, with a big silk"
"3399",120,"handkerchief under my hat for coolness' sake and a brace of pistols"
"3400",120,"ready primed for safety."
"3401",120,""
"3402",120,"I had not gone a hundred yards when I reached the stockade."
"3403",120,""
"3404",120,"This was how it was: a spring of clear water rose almost at the top of a"
"3405",120,"knoll. Well, on the knoll, and enclosing the spring, they had clapped a"
"3406",120,"stout loghouse fit to hold two score of people on a pinch and loopholed"
"3407",120,"for musketry on either side. All round this they had cleared a wide"
"3408",120,"space, and then the thing was completed by a paling six feet high,"
"3409",120,"without door or opening, too strong to pull down without time and labour"
"3410",120,"and too open to shelter the besiegers. The people in the log-house had"
"3411",120,"them in every way; they stood quiet in shelter and shot the others like"
"3412",120,"partridges. All they wanted was a good watch and food; for, short of a"
"3413",120,"complete surprise, they might have held the place against a regiment."

"3417",120,"and ammunition, and things to eat, and excellent wines, there had been"
"3418",120,"one thing overlooked--we had no water. I was thinking this over when"

"3420",120,"death. I was not new to violent death--I have served his Royal Highness"

"3427",120,"up my mind instantly, and with no time lost returned to the shore and"

"3458",120,"and all tumbled down the fore companion, thinking no doubt to take us"
"3459",120,"on the rear. But when they saw Redruth waiting for them in the sparred"
"3460",120,"galley, they went about ship at once, and a head popped out again on"

"3472",120,"This second trip fairly aroused the watchers along shore. ""Lillibullero"""

"3474",120,"little point, one of them whipped ashore and disappeared. I had half a"
"3475",120,"mind to change my plan and destroy their boats, but I feared that Silver"

"3482",120,"guard them--one man, to be sure, but with half a dozen muskets--Hunter"

"3490",120,"advantage of arms. Not one of the men ashore had a musket, and before"
"3491",120,"they could get within range for pistol shooting, we flattered ourselves"
"3492",120,"we should be able to give a good account of a half-dozen at least."

"3497",120,"cargo, with only a musket and a cutlass apiece for the squire and me"
"3498",120,"and Redruth and the captain. The rest of the arms and powder we dropped"

"4240",120,"""Well, here it is,"" said Silver. ""We want that treasure, and we'll have"
"4241",120,"it--that's our point! You would just as soon save your lives, I reckon;"
"4242",120,"and that's yours. You have a chart, haven't you?"""

"4246",120,"""Oh, well, you have, I know that,"" returned Long John. ""You needn't be"
"4247",120,"so husky with a man; there ain't a particle of service in that, and you"
"4248",120,"may lay to it. What I mean is, we want your chart. Now, I never meant"
"4249",120,"you no harm, myself."""

"4269",120,"you are about to take a pipe, cap'n, I'll make so free as do likewise."""
"4270",120,""
"4271",120,"And he filled a pipe and lighted it; and the two men sat silently"
"4272",120,"smoking for quite a while, now looking each other in the face, now"
"4273",120,"stopping their tobacco, now leaning forward to spit. It was as good as"
"4274",120,"the play to see them."
"4275",120,""
"4276",120,"""Now,"" resumed Silver, ""here it is. You give us the chart to get the"
"4277",120,"treasure by, and drop shooting poor seamen and stoving of their heads in"
"4278",120,"while asleep. You do that, and we'll offer you a choice. Either you come"
"4279",120,"aboard along of us, once the treasure shipped, and then I'll give you my"
"4280",120,"affy-davy, upon my word of honour, to clap you somewhere safe ashore. Or"
"4281",120,"if that ain't to your fancy, some of my hands being rough and having"
"4282",120,"old scores on account of hazing, then you can stay here, you can. We'll"
"4283",120,"divide stores with you, man for man; and I'll give my affy-davy, as"
"4284",120,"before to speak the first ship I sight, and send 'em here to pick you"

"4298",120,"""Very good,"" said the captain. ""Now you'll hear me. If you'll come up"
"4299",120,"one by one, unarmed, I'll engage to clap you all in irons and take you"

"4370",120,"say--one about the middle of each side, and on each of these tables some"
"4371",120,"ammunition and four loaded muskets were laid ready to the hand of the"

"4400",120,"and the resin melting in the logs of the block house. Jackets and coats"
"4401",120,"were flung aside, shirts thrown open at the neck and rolled up to the"

"4420",120,"their hands, the captain out in the middle of the block house with his"
"4421",120,"mouth very tight and a frown on his face."
"4422",120,""
"4423",120,"So some seconds passed, till suddenly Joyce whipped up his musket"
"4424",120,"and fired. The report had scarcely died away ere it was repeated and"
"4425",120,"repeated from without in a scattering volley, shot behind shot, like"
"4426",120,"a string of geese, from every side of the enclosure. Several bullets"
"4427",120,"struck the log-house, but not one entered; and as the smoke cleared away"
"4428",120,"and vanished, the stockade and the woods around it looked as quiet and"
"4429",120,"empty as before. Not a bough waved, not the gleam of a musket-barrel"
"4430",120,"betrayed the presence of our foes."
"4431",120,""
"4432",120,"""Did you hit your man?"" asked the captain."

"4438",120,""
"4439",120,"""I know precisely,"" said Dr. Livesey. ""Three shots were fired on this"
"4440",120,"side. I saw the three flashes--two close together--one farther to the"

"4444",120,""
"4445",120,"But this was not so easily answered. There had come many from the"
"4446",120,"north--seven by the squire's computation, eight or nine according to"
"4447",120,"Gray. From the east and west only a single shot had been fired. It was"
"4448",120,"plain, therefore, that the attack would be developed from the north and"
"4449",120,"that on the other three sides we were only to be annoyed by a show of"
"4450",120,"hostilities. But Captain Smollett made no change in his arrangements. If"
"4451",120,"the mutineers succeeded in crossing the stockade, he argued, they would"
"4452",120,"take possession of any unprotected loophole and shoot us down like rats"
"4453",120,"in our own stronghold."
"4454",120,""
"4455",120,"Nor had we much time left to us for thought. Suddenly, with a loud"
"4456",120,"huzza, a little cloud of pirates leaped from the woods on the north side"
"4457",120,"and ran straight on the stockade. At the same moment, the fire was once"
"4458",120,"more opened from the woods, and a rifle ball sang through the doorway"
"4459",120,"and knocked the doctor's musket into bits."
"4460",120,""
"4461",120,"The boarders swarmed over the fence like monkeys. Squire and Gray fired"

"4463",120,"two back on the outside. But of these, one was evidently more frightened"
"4464",120,"than hurt, for he was on his feet again in a crack and instantly"
"4465",120,"disappeared among the trees."
"4466",120,""
"4467",120,"Two had bit the dust, one had fled, four had made good their footing"
"4468",120,"inside our defences, while from the shelter of the woods seven or eight"
"4469",120,"men, each evidently supplied with several muskets, kept up a hot though"
"4470",120,"useless fire on the log-house."

"4473",120,"shouting as they ran, and the men among the trees shouted back to"
"4474",120,"encourage them. Several shots were fired, but such was the hurry of the"
"4475",120,"marksmen that not one appears to have taken effect. In a moment, the"
"4476",120,"four pirates had swarmed up the mound and were upon us."

"4484",120,"muzzle, wrenched it from his hands, plucked it through the loophole,"
"4485",120,"and with one stunning blow, laid the poor fellow senseless on the floor."
"4486",120,"Meanwhile a third, running unharmed all around the house, appeared"

"4503",120,"close behind, I knew not whom. Right in front, the doctor was pursuing"
"4504",120,"his assailant down the hill, and just as my eyes fell upon him, beat"

"4514",120,"flashing in the sunlight. I had not time to be afraid, but as the blow"

"4581",120,"How My Sea Adventure Began"
"4582",120,""
"4583",120,"THERE was no return of the mutineers--not so much as another shot out of"
"4584",120,"the woods. They had ""got their rations for that day,"" as the captain put"
"4585",120,"it, and we had the place to ourselves and a quiet time to overhaul the"
"4586",120,"wounded and get dinner. Squire and I cooked outside in spite of the"
"4587",120,"danger, and even outside we could hardly tell what we were at, for"
"4588",120,"horror of the loud groans that reached us from the doctor's patients."
"4589",120,""
"4590",120,"Out of the eight men who had fallen in the action, only three still"
"4591",120,"breathed--that one of the pirates who had been shot at the loophole,"
"4592",120,"Hunter, and Captain Smollett; and of these, the first two were as good"
"4593",120,"as dead; the mutineer indeed died under the doctor's knife, and Hunter,"
"4594",120,"do what we could, never recovered consciousness in this world. He"
"4595",120,"lingered all day, breathing loudly like the old buccaneer at home in his"
"4596",120,"apoplectic fit, but the bones of his chest had been crushed by the"
"4597",120,"blow and his skull fractured in falling, and some time in the following"
"4598",120,"night, without sign or sound, he went to his Maker."
"4599",120,""
"4600",120,"As for the captain, his wounds were grievous indeed, but not dangerous."
"4601",120,"No organ was fatally injured. Anderson's ball--for it was Job that"
"4602",120,"shot him first--had broken his shoulder-blade and touched the lung, not"
"4603",120,"badly; the second had only torn and displaced some muscles in the calf."
"4604",120,"He was sure to recover, the doctor said, but in the meantime, and for"
"4605",120,"weeks to come, he must not walk nor move his arm, nor so much as speak"
"4606",120,"when he could help it."
"4607",120,""
"4608",120,"My own accidental cut across the knuckles was a flea-bite. Doctor"
"4609",120,"Livesey patched it up with plaster and pulled my ears for me into the"
"4610",120,"bargain."
"4611",120,""
"4612",120,"After dinner the squire and the doctor sat by the captain's side awhile"
"4613",120,"in consultation; and when they had talked to their hearts' content, it"
"4614",120,"being then a little past noon, the doctor took up his hat and pistols,"
"4615",120,"girt on a cutlass, put the chart in his pocket, and with a musket over"
"4616",120,"his shoulder crossed the palisade on the north side and set off briskly"
"4617",120,"through the trees."
"4618",120,""
"4619",120,"Gray and I were sitting together at the far end of the block house, to"
"4620",120,"be out of earshot of our officers consulting; and Gray took his pipe out"
"4621",120,"of his mouth and fairly forgot to put it back again, so thunder-struck"
"4622",120,"he was at this occurrence."
"4623",120,""
"4624",120,"""Why, in the name of Davy Jones,"" said he, ""is Dr. Livesey mad?"""
"4625",120,""
"4626",120,"""Why no,"" says I. ""He's about the last of this crew for that, I take"
"4627",120,"it."""
"4628",120,""
"4629",120,"""Well, shipmate,"" said Gray, ""mad he may not be; but if HE'S not, you"
"4630",120,"mark my words, I am."""
"4631",120,""
"4632",120,"""I take it,"" replied I, ""the doctor has his idea; and if I am right,"
"4633",120,"he's going now to see Ben Gunn."""
"4634",120,""
"4635",120,"I was right, as appeared later; but in the meantime, the house being"
"4636",120,"stifling hot and the little patch of sand inside the palisade ablaze"
"4637",120,"with midday sun, I began to get another thought into my head, which was"
"4638",120,"not by any means so right. What I began to do was to envy the doctor"
"4639",120,"walking in the cool shadow of the woods with the birds about him and the"
"4640",120,"pleasant smell of the pines, while I sat grilling, with my clothes"
"4641",120,"stuck to the hot resin, and so much blood about me and so many poor"
"4642",120,"dead bodies lying all around that I took a disgust of the place that was"
"4643",120,"almost as strong as fear."
"4644",120,""
"4645",120,"All the time I was washing out the block house, and then washing up"
"4646",120,"the things from dinner, this disgust and envy kept growing stronger"
"4647",120,"and stronger, till at last, being near a bread-bag, and no one then"
"4648",120,"observing me, I took the first step towards my escapade and filled both"
"4649",120,"pockets of my coat with biscuit."
"4650",120,""
"4651",120,"I was a fool, if you like, and certainly I was going to do a foolish,"
"4652",120,"over-bold act; but I was determined to do it with all the precautions in"
"4653",120,"my power. These biscuits, should anything befall me, would keep me, at"
"4654",120,"least, from starving till far on in the next day."
"4655",120,""
"4656",120,"The next thing I laid hold of was a brace of pistols, and as I already"
"4657",120,"had a powder-horn and bullets, I felt myself well supplied with arms."
"4658",120,""
"4659",120,"As for the scheme I had in my head, it was not a bad one in itself. I"
"4660",120,"was to go down the sandy spit that divides the anchorage on the east"
"4661",120,"from the open sea, find the white rock I had observed last evening, and"
"4662",120,"ascertain whether it was there or not that Ben Gunn had hidden his boat,"
"4663",120,"a thing quite worth doing, as I still believe. But as I was certain I"
"4664",120,"should not be allowed to leave the enclosure, my only plan was to take"
"4665",120,"French leave and slip out when nobody was watching, and that was so bad"
"4666",120,"a way of doing it as made the thing itself wrong. But I was only a boy,"
"4667",120,"and I had made my mind up."
"4668",120,""
"4669",120,"Well, as things at last fell out, I found an admirable opportunity. The"
"4670",120,"squire and Gray were busy helping the captain with his bandages, the"
"4671",120,"coast was clear, I made a bolt for it over the stockade and into the"
"4672",120,"thickest of the trees, and before my absence was observed I was out of"
"4673",120,"cry of my companions."
"4674",120,""
"4675",120,"This was my second folly, far worse than the first, as I left but two"
"4676",120,"sound men to guard the house; but like the first, it was a help towards"
"4677",120,"saving all of us."
"4678",120,""
"4679",120,"I took my way straight for the east coast of the island, for I was"
"4680",120,"determined to go down the sea side of the spit to avoid all chance of"
"4681",120,"observation from the anchorage. It was already late in the afternoon,"
"4682",120,"although still warm and sunny. As I continued to thread the tall woods,"
"4683",120,"I could hear from far before me not only the continuous thunder of the"
"4684",120,"surf, but a certain tossing of foliage and grinding of boughs which"
"4685",120,"showed me the sea breeze had set in higher than usual. Soon cool"
"4686",120,"draughts of air began to reach me, and a few steps farther I came forth"
"4687",120,"into the open borders of the grove, and saw the sea lying blue and sunny"
"4688",120,"to the horizon and the surf tumbling and tossing its foam along the"
"4689",120,"beach."
"4690",120,""
"4691",120,"I have never seen the sea quiet round Treasure Island. The sun might"
"4692",120,"blaze overhead, the air be without a breath, the surface smooth and"
"4693",120,"blue, but still these great rollers would be running along all the"
"4694",120,"external coast, thundering and thundering by day and night; and I scarce"
"4695",120,"believe there is one spot in the island where a man would be out of"
"4696",120,"earshot of their noise."
"4697",120,""
"4698",120,"I walked along beside the surf with great enjoyment, till, thinking"
"4699",120,"I was now got far enough to the south, I took the cover of some thick"
"4700",120,"bushes and crept warily up to the ridge of the spit."
"4701",120,""
"4702",120,"Behind me was the sea, in front the anchorage. The sea breeze, as though"
"4703",120,"it had the sooner blown itself out by its unusual violence, was already"
"4704",120,"at an end; it had been succeeded by light, variable airs from the south"
"4705",120,"and south-east, carrying great banks of fog; and the anchorage, under"
"4706",120,"lee of Skeleton Island, lay still and leaden as when first we entered"
"4707",120,"it. The HISPANIOLA, in that unbroken mirror, was exactly portrayed from"
"4708",120,"the truck to the waterline, the Jolly Roger hanging from her peak."
"4709",120,""
"4710",120,"Alongside lay one of the gigs, Silver in the stern-sheets--him I could"
"4711",120,"always recognize--while a couple of men were leaning over the stern"
"4712",120,"bulwarks, one of them with a red cap--the very rogue that I had seen"
"4713",120,"some hours before stride-legs upon the palisade. Apparently they were"
"4714",120,"talking and laughing, though at that distance--upwards of a mile--I"
"4715",120,"could, of course, hear no word of what was said. All at once there began"
"4716",120,"the most horrid, unearthly screaming, which at first startled me badly,"
"4717",120,"though I had soon remembered the voice of Captain Flint and even thought"
"4718",120,"I could make out the bird by her bright plumage as she sat perched upon"
"4719",120,"her master's wrist."
"4720",120,""
"4721",120,"Soon after, the jolly-boat shoved off and pulled for shore, and the man"
"4722",120,"with the red cap and his comrade went below by the cabin companion."
"4723",120,""
"4724",120,"Just about the same time, the sun had gone down behind the Spy-glass,"
"4725",120,"and as the fog was collecting rapidly, it began to grow dark in earnest."
"4726",120,"I saw I must lose no time if I were to find the boat that evening."
"4727",120,""
"4728",120,"The white rock, visible enough above the brush, was still some eighth of"
"4729",120,"a mile further down the spit, and it took me a goodish while to get up"
"4730",120,"with it, crawling, often on all fours, among the scrub. Night had almost"
"4731",120,"come when I laid my hand on its rough sides. Right below it there was"
"4732",120,"an exceedingly small hollow of green turf, hidden by banks and a thick"
"4733",120,"underwood about knee-deep, that grew there very plentifully; and in the"
"4734",120,"centre of the dell, sure enough, a little tent of goat-skins, like what"
"4735",120,"the gipsies carry about with them in England."
"4736",120,""
"4737",120,"I dropped into the hollow, lifted the side of the tent, and there was"
"4738",120,"Ben Gunn's boat--home-made if ever anything was home-made; a rude,"
"4739",120,"lop-sided framework of tough wood, and stretched upon that a covering of"
"4740",120,"goat-skin, with the hair inside. The thing was extremely small, even"
"4741",120,"for me, and I can hardly imagine that it could have floated with a"
"4742",120,"full-sized man. There was one thwart set as low as possible, a kind of"
"4743",120,"stretcher in the bows, and a double paddle for propulsion."
"4744",120,""
"4745",120,"I had not then seen a coracle, such as the ancient Britons made, but"
"4746",120,"I have seen one since, and I can give you no fairer idea of Ben Gunn's"
"4747",120,"boat than by saying it was like the first and the worst coracle ever"
"4748",120,"made by man. But the great advantage of the coracle it certainly"
"4749",120,"possessed, for it was exceedingly light and portable."
"4750",120,""
"4751",120,"Well, now that I had found the boat, you would have thought I had had"
"4752",120,"enough of truantry for once, but in the meantime I had taken another"
"4753",120,"notion and become so obstinately fond of it that I would have carried"
"4754",120,"it out, I believe, in the teeth of Captain Smollett himself. This was"
"4755",120,"to slip out under cover of the night, cut the HISPANIOLA adrift, and let"
"4756",120,"her go ashore where she fancied. I had quite made up my mind that the"
"4757",120,"mutineers, after their repulse of the morning, had nothing nearer their"
"4758",120,"hearts than to up anchor and away to sea; this, I thought, it would be"
"4759",120,"a fine thing to prevent, and now that I had seen how they left their"
"4760",120,"watchmen unprovided with a boat, I thought it might be done with little"
"4761",120,"risk."
"4762",120,""
"4763",120,"Down I sat to wait for darkness, and made a hearty meal of biscuit. It"
"4764",120,"was a night out of ten thousand for my purpose. The fog had now buried"
"4765",120,"all heaven. As the last rays of daylight dwindled and disappeared,"
"4766",120,"absolute blackness settled down on Treasure Island. And when, at last,"
"4767",120,"I shouldered the coracle and groped my way stumblingly out of the hollow"
"4768",120,"where I had supped, there were but two points visible on the whole"
"4769",120,"anchorage."
"4770",120,""
"4771",120,"One was the great fire on shore, by which the defeated pirates lay"
"4772",120,"carousing in the swamp. The other, a mere blur of light upon the"
"4773",120,"darkness, indicated the position of the anchored ship. She had swung"
"4774",120,"round to the ebb--her bow was now towards me--the only lights on board"
"4775",120,"were in the cabin, and what I saw was merely a reflection on the fog of"
"4776",120,"the strong rays that flowed from the stern window."
"4777",120,""
"4778",120,"The ebb had already run some time, and I had to wade through a long belt"
"4779",120,"of swampy sand, where I sank several times above the ankle, before I"
"4780",120,"came to the edge of the retreating water, and wading a little way in,"
"4781",120,"with some strength and dexterity, set my coracle, keel downwards, on the"
"4782",120,"surface."
"4783",120,""
"4784",120,""
"4785",120,""

"4789",120,"The Ebb-tide Runs"
"4790",120,""
"4791",120,"THE coracle--as I had ample reason to know before I was done with"
"4792",120,"her--was a very safe boat for a person of my height and weight, both"
"4793",120,"buoyant and clever in a seaway; but she was the most cross-grained,"
"4794",120,"lop-sided craft to manage. Do as you pleased, she always made more"
"4795",120,"leeway than anything else, and turning round and round was the manoeuvre"
"4796",120,"she was best at. Even Ben Gunn himself has admitted that she was ""queer"
"4797",120,"to handle till you knew her way."""
"4798",120,""
"4799",120,"Certainly I did not know her way. She turned in every direction but the"
"4800",120,"one I was bound to go; the most part of the time we were broadside on,"
"4801",120,"and I am very sure I never should have made the ship at all but for the"
"4802",120,"tide. By good fortune, paddle as I pleased, the tide was still sweeping"
"4803",120,"me down; and there lay the HISPANIOLA right in the fairway, hardly to be"
"4804",120,"missed."
"4805",120,""
"4806",120,"First she loomed before me like a blot of something yet blacker than"
"4807",120,"darkness, then her spars and hull began to take shape, and the next"
"4808",120,"moment, as it seemed (for, the farther I went, the brisker grew the"
"4809",120,"current of the ebb), I was alongside of her hawser and had laid hold."
"4810",120,""
"4811",120,"The hawser was as taut as a bowstring, and the current so strong she"
"4812",120,"pulled upon her anchor. All round the hull, in the blackness, the"
"4813",120,"rippling current bubbled and chattered like a little mountain stream."
"4814",120,"One cut with my sea-gully and the HISPANIOLA would go humming down the"
"4815",120,"tide."
"4816",120,""
"4817",120,"So far so good, but it next occurred to my recollection that a taut"
"4818",120,"hawser, suddenly cut, is a thing as dangerous as a kicking horse. Ten to"
"4819",120,"one, if I were so foolhardy as to cut the HISPANIOLA from her anchor, I"
"4820",120,"and the coracle would be knocked clean out of the water."
"4821",120,""
"4822",120,"This brought me to a full stop, and if fortune had not again"
"4823",120,"particularly favoured me, I should have had to abandon my design. But"
"4824",120,"the light airs which had begun blowing from the south-east and south"
"4825",120,"had hauled round after nightfall into the south-west. Just while I was"
"4826",120,"meditating, a puff came, caught the HISPANIOLA, and forced her up into"
"4827",120,"the current; and to my great joy, I felt the hawser slacken in my grasp,"
"4828",120,"and the hand by which I held it dip for a second under water."
"4829",120,""
"4830",120,"With that I made my mind up, took out my gully, opened it with my teeth,"
"4831",120,"and cut one strand after another, till the vessel swung only by two."
"4832",120,"Then I lay quiet, waiting to sever these last when the strain should be"
"4833",120,"once more lightened by a breath of wind."
"4834",120,""
"4835",120,"All this time I had heard the sound of loud voices from the cabin, but"
"4836",120,"to say truth, my mind had been so entirely taken up with other thoughts"
"4837",120,"that I had scarcely given ear. Now, however, when I had nothing else to"
"4838",120,"do, I began to pay more heed."
"4839",120,""
"4840",120,"One I recognized for the coxswain's, Israel Hands, that had been Flint's"
"4841",120,"gunner in former days. The other was, of course, my friend of the red"
"4842",120,"night-cap. Both men were plainly the worse of drink, and they were still"
"4843",120,"drinking, for even while I was listening, one of them, with a drunken"
"4844",120,"cry, opened the stern window and threw out something, which I divined to"
"4845",120,"be an empty bottle. But they were not only tipsy; it was plain that they"
"4846",120,"were furiously angry. Oaths flew like hailstones, and every now and"
"4847",120,"then there came forth such an explosion as I thought was sure to end"
"4848",120,"in blows. But each time the quarrel passed off and the voices grumbled"
"4849",120,"lower for a while, until the next crisis came and in its turn passed"
"4850",120,"away without result."
"4851",120,""
"4852",120,"On shore, I could see the glow of the great camp-fire burning warmly"
"4853",120,"through the shore-side trees. Someone was singing, a dull, old, droning"
"4854",120,"sailor's song, with a droop and a quaver at the end of every verse,"
"4855",120,"and seemingly no end to it at all but the patience of the singer. I had"
"4856",120,"heard it on the voyage more than once and remembered these words:"
"4857",120,""
"4858",120,"     ""But one man of her crew alive,"
"4859",120,"     What put to sea with seventy-five."""
"4860",120,""
"4861",120,"And I thought it was a ditty rather too dolefully appropriate for a"
"4862",120,"company that had met such cruel losses in the morning. But, indeed, from"
"4863",120,"what I saw, all these buccaneers were as callous as the sea they sailed"
"4864",120,"on."
"4865",120,""
"4866",120,"At last the breeze came; the schooner sidled and drew nearer in the"
"4867",120,"dark; I felt the hawser slacken once more, and with a good, tough"
"4868",120,"effort, cut the last fibres through."
"4869",120,""
"4870",120,"The breeze had but little action on the coracle, and I was almost"
"4871",120,"instantly swept against the bows of the HISPANIOLA. At the same time,"
"4872",120,"the schooner began to turn upon her heel, spinning slowly, end for end,"
"4873",120,"across the current."
"4874",120,""
"4875",120,"I wrought like a fiend, for I expected every moment to be swamped; and"
"4876",120,"since I found I could not push the coracle directly off, I now shoved"
"4877",120,"straight astern. At length I was clear of my dangerous neighbour, and"
"4878",120,"just as I gave the last impulsion, my hands came across a light cord"
"4879",120,"that was trailing overboard across the stern bulwarks. Instantly I"
"4880",120,"grasped it."
"4881",120,""
"4882",120,"Why I should have done so I can hardly say. It was at first mere"
"4883",120,"instinct, but once I had it in my hands and found it fast, curiosity"
"4884",120,"began to get the upper hand, and I determined I should have one look"
"4885",120,"through the cabin window."
"4886",120,""
"4887",120,"I pulled in hand over hand on the cord, and when I judged myself near"
"4888",120,"enough, rose at infinite risk to about half my height and thus commanded"
"4889",120,"the roof and a slice of the interior of the cabin."
"4890",120,""
"4891",120,"By this time the schooner and her little consort were gliding pretty"
"4892",120,"swiftly through the water; indeed, we had already fetched up level with"
"4893",120,"the camp-fire. The ship was talking, as sailors say, loudly, treading"
"4894",120,"the innumerable ripples with an incessant weltering splash; and until I"

"4930",120,"the little dancing coracle; ever quickening, ever bubbling higher, ever"

"5068",120,"north-west, and I presumed the men on board were going round the island"
"5069",120,"on their way back to the anchorage. Presently she began to fetch more"
"5070",120,"and more to the westward, so that I thought they had sighted me and were"
"5071",120,"going about in chase. At last, however, she fell right into the wind's"
"5072",120,"eye, was taken dead aback, and stood there awhile helpless, with her"

"5080",120,"in the wind's eye. Again and again was this repeated. To and fro, up and"
"5081",120,"down, north, south, east, and west, the HISPANIOLA sailed by swoops"
"5082",120,"and dashes, and at each repetition ended as she had begun, with idly"
"5083",120,"flapping canvas. It became plain to me that nobody was steering. And if"
"5084",120,"so, where were the men? Either they were dead drunk or had deserted her,"

"5088",120,"The current was bearing coracle and schooner southward at an equal rate."
"5089",120,"As for the latter's sailing, it was so wild and intermittent, and she"
"5090",120,"hung each time so long in irons, that she certainly gained nothing, if"
"5091",120,"she did not even lose. If only I dared to sit up and paddle, I made"
"5092",120,"sure that I could overhaul her. The scheme had an air of adventure"
"5093",120,"that inspired me, and the thought of the water breaker beside the fore"
"5094",120,"companion doubled my growing courage."
"5095",120,""
"5096",120,"Up I got, was welcomed almost instantly by another cloud of spray, but"
"5097",120,"this time stuck to my purpose and set myself, with all my strength and"
"5098",120,"caution, to paddle after the unsteered HISPANIOLA. Once I shipped a sea"
"5099",120,"so heavy that I had to stop and bail, with my heart fluttering like"
"5100",120,"a bird, but gradually I got into the way of the thing and guided my"

"5106",120,"decks. I could not choose but suppose she was deserted. If not, the men"
"5107",120,"were lying drunk below, where I might batten them down, perhaps, and do"
"5108",120,"what I chose with the ship."
"5109",120,""
"5110",120,"For some time she had been doing the worse thing possible for"
"5111",120,"me--standing still. She headed nearly due south, yawing, of course, all"
"5112",120,"the time. Each time she fell off, her sails partly filled, and these"

"5125",120,"stock-still but for the current."
"5126",120,""

"5221",120,"It was such a scene of confusion as you can hardly fancy. All the"
"5222",120,"lockfast places had been broken open in quest of the chart. The floor"
"5223",120,"was thick with mud where ruffians had sat down to drink or consult after"
"5224",120,"wading in the marshes round their camp. The bulkheads, all painted in"
"5225",120,"clear white and beaded round with gilt, bore a pattern of dirty hands."
"5226",120,"Dozens of empty bottles clinked together in corners to the rolling of"
"5227",120,"the ship. One of the doctor's medical books lay open on the table, half"
"5228",120,"of the leaves gutted out, I suppose, for pipelights. In the midst of all"
"5229",120,"this the lamp still cast a smoky glow, obscure and brown as umber."
"5230",120,""
"5231",120,"I went into the cellar; all the barrels were gone, and of the bottles"
"5232",120,"a most surprising number had been drunk out and thrown away. Certainly,"
"5233",120,"since the mutiny began, not a man of them could ever have been sober."

"5235",120,"Foraging about, I found a bottle with some brandy left, for Hands; and"
"5236",120,"for myself I routed out some biscuit, some pickled fruits, a great bunch"
"5237",120,"of raisins, and a piece of cheese. With these I came on deck, put down"
"5238",120,"my own stock behind the rudder head and well out of the coxswain's"
"5239",120,"reach, went forward to the water-breaker, and had a good deep drink of"
"5240",120,"water, and then, and not till then, gave Hands the brandy."

"5248",120,"""Much hurt?"" I asked him."
"5249",120,""
"5250",120,"He grunted, or rather, I might say, he barked."

"5252",120,"""If that doctor was aboard,"" he said, ""I'd be right enough in a couple"
"5253",120,"of turns, but I don't have no manner of luck, you see, and that's what's"

"5299",120,"So I would."""
"5300",120,""
"5301",120,"Well, as it seemed to me, there was some sense in this. We struck our"
"5302",120,"bargain on the spot. In three minutes I had the HISPANIOLA sailing"
"5303",120,"easily before the wind along the coast of Treasure Island, with good"
"5304",120,"hopes of turning the northern point ere noon and beating down again as"
"5305",120,"far as North Inlet before high water, when we might beach her safely and"
"5306",120,"wait till the subsiding tide permitted us to land."
"5307",120,""
"5308",120,"Then I lashed the tiller and went below to my own chest, where I got a"
"5309",120,"soft silk handkerchief of my mother's. With this, and with my aid, Hands"
"5310",120,"bound up the great bleeding stab he had received in the thigh, and after"
"5311",120,"he had eaten a little and had a swallow or two more of the brandy, he"
"5312",120,"began to pick up visibly, sat straighter up, spoke louder and clearer,"

"5318",120,"sparsely dotted with dwarf pines, and soon we were beyond that again"

"5324",120,"plenty of water and good things to eat, and my conscience, which had"
"5325",120,"smitten me hard for my desertion, was quieted by the great conquest I"

"5329",120,"that had in it something both of pain and weakness--a haggard old man's"
"5330",120,"smile; but there was, besides that, a grain of derision, a shadow of"
"5331",120,"treachery, in his expression as he craftily watched, and watched, and"

"5376",120,"Now, the coxswain's hesitation seemed to be unnatural, and as for the"
"5377",120,"notion of his preferring wine to brandy, I entirely disbelieved it. The"
"5378",120,"whole story was a pretext. He wanted me to leave the deck--so much was"
"5379",120,"plain; but with what purpose I could in no way imagine. His eyes never"
"5380",120,"met mine; they kept wandering to and fro, up and down, now with a look"
"5381",120,"to the sky, now with a flitting glance upon the dead O'Brien. All the"

"5383",120,"embarrassed manner, so that a child could have told that he was bent on"
"5384",120,"some deception. I was prompt with my answer, however, for I saw where"

"5397",120,"slipped off my shoes, ran quietly along the sparred gallery, mounted the"
"5398",120,"forecastle ladder, and popped my head out of the fore companion. I"
"5399",120,"knew he would not expect to see me there, yet I took every precaution"

"5404",120,"him stifle a groan--yet it was at a good, rattling rate that he trailed"
"5405",120,"himself across the deck. In half a minute he had reached the port"
"5406",120,"scuppers and picked, out of a coil of rope, a long knife, or rather a"
"5407",120,"short dirk, discoloured to the hilt with blood. He looked upon it for"

"5415",120,"afterwards--whether he would try to crawl right across the island from"
"5416",120,"North Inlet to the camp among the swamps or whether he would fire Long"

"5423",120,"sheltered place, and so that, when the time came, she could be got off"

"5471",120,"handled to be got in. I think I was a good, prompt subaltern, and I am"
"5472",120,"very sure that Hands was an excellent pilot, for we went about and about"
"5473",120,"and dodged in, shaving the banks, with a certainty and a neatness that"

"5475",120,""
"5476",120,"Scarcely had we passed the heads before the land closed around us. The"

"5478",120,"anchorage, but the space was longer and narrower and more like, what in"
"5479",120,"truth it was, the estuary of a river. Right before us, at the southern"
"5480",120,"end, we saw the wreck of a ship in the last stages of dilapidation. It"
"5481",120,"had been a great vessel of three masts but had lain so long exposed to"
"5482",120,"the injuries of the weather that it was hung about with great webs of"
"5483",120,"dripping seaweed, and on the deck of it shore bushes had taken root and"
"5484",120,"now flourished thick with flowers. It was a sad sight, but it showed us"

"5530",120,"the priming was useless with sea-water. I cursed myself for my neglect."
"5531",120,"Why had not I, long before, reprimed and reloaded my only weapons? Then"
"5532",120,"I should not have been as now, a mere fleeing sheep before this butcher."
"5533",120,""
"5534",120,"Wounded as he was, it was wonderful how fast he could move, his grizzled"
"5535",120,"hair tumbling over his face, and his face itself as red as a red ensign"
"5536",120,"with his haste and fury. I had no time to try my other pistol, nor"
"5537",120,"indeed much inclination, for I was sure it would be useless. One thing I"
"5538",120,"saw plainly: I must not simply retreat before him, or he would speedily"
"5539",120,"hold me boxed into the bows, as a moment since he had so nearly boxed"
"5540",120,"me in the stern. Once so caught, and nine or ten inches of the"
"5541",120,"blood-stained dirk would be my last experience on this side of eternity."
"5542",120,"I placed my palms against the main-mast, which was of a goodish bigness,"
"5543",120,"and waited, every nerve upon the stretch."
"5544",120,""
"5545",120,"Seeing that I meant to dodge, he also paused; and a moment or two passed"
"5546",120,"in feints on his part and corresponding movements upon mine. It was such"
"5547",120,"a game as I had often played at home about the rocks of Black Hill Cove,"
"5548",120,"but never before, you may be sure, with such a wildly beating heart as"
"5549",120,"now. Still, as I say, it was a boy's game, and I thought I could hold"
"5550",120,"my own at it against an elderly seaman with a wounded thigh. Indeed my"
"5551",120,"courage had begun to rise so high that I allowed myself a few darting"
"5552",120,"thoughts on what would be the end of the affair, and while I saw"
"5553",120,"certainly that I could spin it out for long, I saw no hope of any"
"5554",120,"ultimate escape."
"5555",120,""
"5556",120,"Well, while things stood thus, suddenly the HISPANIOLA struck,"
"5557",120,"staggered, ground for an instant in the sand, and then, swift as a"
"5558",120,"blow, canted over to the port side till the deck stood at an angle"
"5559",120,"of forty-five degrees and about a puncheon of water splashed into the"
"5560",120,"scupper holes and lay, in a pool, between the deck and bulwark."

"5565",120,"head came against the coxswain's foot with a crack that made my teeth"
"5566",120,"rattle. Blow and all, I was the first afoot again, for Hands had got"
"5567",120,"involved with the dead body. The sudden canting of the ship had made the"
"5568",120,"deck no place for running on; I had to find some new way of escape,"
"5569",120,"and that upon the instant, for my foe was almost touching me. Quick as"
"5570",120,"thought, I sprang into the mizzen shrouds, rattled up hand over hand,"
"5571",120,"and did not draw a breath till I was seated on the cross-trees."
"5572",120,""

"5586",120,"slowly and painfully to mount. It cost him no end of time and groans"
"5587",120,"to haul his wounded leg behind him, and I had quietly finished my"
"5588",120,"arrangements before he was much more than a third of the way up. Then,"

"5594",120,"He stopped instantly. I could see by the working of his face that he was"
"5595",120,"trying to think, and the process was so slow and laborious that, in my"
"5596",120,"new-found security, I laughed aloud. At last, with a swallow or two, he"
"5597",120,"spoke, his face still wearing the same expression of extreme perplexity."

"5648",120,"It was my first thought to pluck forth the dirk, but either it stuck too"

"5650",120,"enough, that very shudder did the business. The knife, in fact, had come"
"5651",120,"the nearest in the world to missing me altogether; it held me by a mere"
"5652",120,"pinch of skin, and this the shudder tore away. The blood ran down the"
"5653",120,"faster, to be sure, but I was my own master again and only tacked to the"

"5664",120,"ship was now, in a sense, my own, I began to think of clearing it from"
"5665",120,"its last passenger--the dead man, O'Brien."
"5666",120,""
"5667",120,"He had pitched, as I have said, against the bulwarks, where he lay"
"5668",120,"like some horrible, ungainly sort of puppet, life-size, indeed, but how"
"5669",120,"different from life's colour or life's comeliness! In that position"
"5670",120,"I could easily have my way with him, and as the habit of tragical"
"5671",120,"adventures had worn off almost all my terror for the dead, I took him"
"5672",120,"by the waist as if he had been a sack of bran and with one good heave,"
"5673",120,"tumbled him overboard. He went in with a sounding plunge; the red cap"
"5674",120,"came off and remained floating on the surface; and as soon as the splash"
"5675",120,"subsided, I could see him and Israel lying side by side, both wavering"
"5676",120,"with the tremulous movement of the water. O'Brien, though still quite a"
"5677",120,"young man, was very bald. There he lay, with that bald head across the"
"5678",120,"knees of the man who had killed him and the quick fishes steering to and"
"5679",120,"fro over both."
"5680",120,""
"5681",120,"I was now alone upon the ship; the tide had just turned. The sun was"
"5682",120,"within so few degrees of setting that already the shadow of the pines"
"5683",120,"upon the western shore began to reach right across the anchorage and"
"5684",120,"fall in patterns on the deck. The evening breeze had sprung up, and"
"5685",120,"though it was well warded off by the hill with the two peaks upon the"
"5686",120,"east, the cordage had begun to sing a little softly to itself and the"
"5687",120,"idle sails to rattle to and fro."
"5688",120,""
"5689",120,"I began to see a danger to the ship. The jibs I speedily doused and"
"5690",120,"brought tumbling to the deck, but the main-sail was a harder matter. Of"
"5691",120,"course, when the schooner canted over, the boom had swung out-board, and"
"5692",120,"the cap of it and a foot or two of sail hung even under water. I thought"
"5693",120,"this made it still more dangerous; yet the strain was so heavy that I"
"5694",120,"half feared to meddle. At last I got my knife and cut the halyards. The"
"5695",120,"peak dropped instantly, a great belly of loose canvas floated broad upon"
"5696",120,"the water, and since, pull as I liked, I could not budge the downhall,"
"5697",120,"that was the extent of what I could accomplish. For the rest, the"
"5698",120,"HISPANIOLA must trust to luck, like myself."
"5699",120,""
"5700",120,"By this time the whole anchorage had fallen into shadow--the last rays,"
"5701",120,"I remember, falling through a glade of the wood and shining bright as"
"5702",120,"jewels on the flowery mantle of the wreck. It began to be chill; the"
"5703",120,"tide was rapidly fleeting seaward, the schooner settling more and more"
"5704",120,"on her beam-ends."
"5705",120,""
"5706",120,"I scrambled forward and looked over. It seemed shallow enough, and"
"5707",120,"holding the cut hawser in both hands for a last security, I let myself"
"5708",120,"drop softly overboard. The water scarcely reached my waist; the sand was"
"5709",120,"firm and covered with ripple marks, and I waded ashore in great spirits,"
"5710",120,"leaving the HISPANIOLA on her side, with her main-sail trailing wide"
"5711",120,"upon the surface of the bay. About the same time, the sun went fairly"
"5712",120,"down and the breeze whistled low in the dusk among the tossing pines."
"5713",120,""
"5714",120,"At least, and at last, I was off the sea, nor had I returned thence"
"5715",120,"empty-handed. There lay the schooner, clear at last from buccaneers"
"5716",120,"and ready for our own men to board and get to sea again. I had nothing"
"5717",120,"nearer my fancy than to get home to the stockade and boast of my"
"5718",120,"achievements. Possibly I might be blamed a bit for my truantry, but the"
"5719",120,"recapture of the HISPANIOLA was a clenching answer, and I hoped that"
"5720",120,"even Captain Smollett would confess I had not lost my time."
"5721",120,""
"5722",120,"So thinking, and in famous spirits, I began to set my face homeward for"
"5723",120,"the block house and my companions. I remembered that the most easterly"
"5724",120,"of the rivers which drain into Captain Kidd's anchorage ran from the"
"5725",120,"two-peaked hill upon my left, and I bent my course in that direction"
"5726",120,"that I might pass the stream while it was small. The wood was pretty"
"5727",120,"open, and keeping along the lower spurs, I had soon turned the corner"
"5728",120,"of that hill, and not long after waded to the mid-calf across the"
"5729",120,"watercourse."
"5730",120,""
"5731",120,"This brought me near to where I had encountered Ben Gunn, the maroon;"
"5732",120,"and I walked more circumspectly, keeping an eye on every side. The dusk"
"5733",120,"had come nigh hand completely, and as I opened out the cleft between the"
"5734",120,"two peaks, I became aware of a wavering glow against the sky, where, as"
"5735",120,"I judged, the man of the island was cooking his supper before a roaring"
"5736",120,"fire. And yet I wondered, in my heart, that he should show himself so"
"5737",120,"careless. For if I could see this radiance, might it not reach the eyes"
"5738",120,"of Silver himself where he camped upon the shore among the marshes?"
"5739",120,""
"5740",120,"Gradually the night fell blacker; it was all I could do to guide myself"
"5741",120,"even roughly towards my destination; the double hill behind me and the"
"5742",120,"Spy-glass on my right hand loomed faint and fainter; the stars were few"
"5743",120,"and pale; and in the low ground where I wandered I kept tripping among"
"5744",120,"bushes and rolling into sandy pits."
"5745",120,""
"5746",120,"Suddenly a kind of brightness fell about me. I looked up; a pale glimmer"
"5747",120,"of moonbeams had alighted on the summit of the Spy-glass, and soon after"
"5748",120,"I saw something broad and silvery moving low down behind the trees, and"
"5749",120,"knew the moon had risen."
"5750",120,""
"5751",120,"With this to help me, I passed rapidly over what remained to me of my"
"5752",120,"journey, and sometimes walking, sometimes running, impatiently drew near"
"5753",120,"to the stockade. Yet, as I began to thread the grove that lies before"
"5754",120,"it, I was not so thoughtless but that I slacked my pace and went a"
"5755",120,"trifle warily. It would have been a poor end of my adventures to get"
"5756",120,"shot down by my own party in mistake."
"5757",120,""
"5758",120,"The moon was climbing higher and higher, its light began to fall here"
"5759",120,"and there in masses through the more open districts of the wood, and"
"5760",120,"right in front of me a glow of a different colour appeared among"
"5761",120,"the trees. It was red and hot, and now and again it was a little"
"5762",120,"darkened--as it were, the embers of a bonfire smouldering."
"5763",120,""
"5764",120,"For the life of me I could not think what it might be."
"5765",120,""
"5766",120,"At last I came right down upon the borders of the clearing. The western"
"5767",120,"end was already steeped in moonshine; the rest, and the block house"
"5768",120,"itself, still lay in a black shadow chequered with long silvery streaks"
"5769",120,"of light. On the other side of the house an immense fire had burned"
"5770",120,"itself into clear embers and shed a steady, red reverberation,"
"5771",120,"contrasted strongly with the mellow paleness of the moon. There was not"
"5772",120,"a soul stirring nor a sound beside the noises of the breeze."
"5773",120,""
"5774",120,"I stopped, with much wonder in my heart, and perhaps a little terror"
"5775",120,"also. It had not been our way to build great fires; we were, indeed,"
"5776",120,"by the captain's orders, somewhat niggardly of firewood, and I began to"
"5777",120,"fear that something had gone wrong while I was absent."
"5778",120,""
"5779",120,"I stole round by the eastern end, keeping close in shadow, and at a"
"5780",120,"convenient place, where the darkness was thickest, crossed the palisade."
"5781",120,""
"5782",120,"To make assurance surer, I got upon my hands and knees and crawled,"
"5783",120,"without a sound, towards the corner of the house. As I drew nearer, my"
"5784",120,"heart was suddenly and greatly lightened. It is not a pleasant noise in"
"5785",120,"itself, and I have often complained of it at other times, but just"
"5786",120,"then it was like music to hear my friends snoring together so loud and"
"5787",120,"peaceful in their sleep. The sea-cry of the watch, that beautiful ""All's"
"5788",120,"well,"" never fell more reassuringly on my ear."
"5789",120,""
"5790",120,"In the meantime, there was no doubt of one thing; they kept an infamous"
"5791",120,"bad watch. If it had been Silver and his lads that were now creeping"
"5792",120,"in on them, not a soul would have seen daybreak. That was what it"
"5793",120,"was, thought I, to have the captain wounded; and again I blamed myself"
"5794",120,"sharply for leaving them in that danger with so few to mount guard."
"5795",120,""
"5796",120,"By this time I had got to the door and stood up. All was dark within,"
"5797",120,"so that I could distinguish nothing by the eye. As for sounds, there"
"5798",120,"was the steady drone of the snorers and a small occasional noise, a"
"5799",120,"flickering or pecking that I could in no way account for."
"5800",120,""
"5801",120,"With my arms before me I walked steadily in. I should lie down in my own"
"5802",120,"place (I thought with a silent chuckle) and enjoy their faces when they"

"5804",120,""
"5805",120,"My foot struck something yielding--it was a sleeper's leg; and he turned"

"5808",120,"And then, all of a sudden, a shrill voice broke forth out of the"

"5856",120,"called out of the first sleep of drunkenness. The sixth had only risen"
"5857",120,"upon his elbow; he was deadly pale, and the blood-stained bandage round"
"5858",120,"his head told that he had recently been wounded, and still more recently"
"5859",120,"dressed. I remembered the man who had been shot and had run back among"

"5968",120,"did it--it was I! I was in the apple barrel the night we sighted land,"

"5970",120,"the bottom of the sea, and told every word you said before the hour was"

"5972",120,"that killed the men you had aboard of her, and it was I who brought her"
"5973",120,"where you'll never see her more, not one of you. The laugh's on my side;"
"5974",120,"I've had the top of this business from the first; I no more fear you"

"6044",120,"been in church; yet his eye kept wandering furtively, and he kept the"
"6045",120,"tail of it on his unruly followers. They, on their part, drew gradually"
"6046",120,"together towards the far end of the block house, and the low hiss of"
"6047",120,"their whispering sounded in my ear continuously, like a stream. One"
"6048",120,"after another, they would look up, and the red light of the torch would"
"6049",120,"fall for a second on their nervous faces; but it was not towards me, it"

"6267",120,"to waste a hostage? No, not us; he might be our last chance, and I"
"6268",120,"shouldn't wonder. Kill that boy? Not me, mates! And number three? Ah,"
"6269",120,"well, there's a deal to say to number three. Maybe you don't count it"
"6270",120,"nothing to have a real college doctor to see you every day--you, John,"
"6271",120,"with your head broke--or you, George Merry, that had the ague shakes"
"6272",120,"upon you not six hours agone, and has your eyes the colour of lemon peel"

"6491",120,"the rest were, and his last night's victory had given him a huge"

"7120",120,"""Dig away, boys,"" said Silver with the coolest insolence; ""you'll find"
"7121",120,"some pig-nuts and I shouldn't wonder."""
"7122",120,""
"7123",120,"""Pig-nuts!"" repeated Merry, in a scream. ""Mates, do you hear that? I"
"7124",120,"tell you now, that man there knew it all along. Look in the face of him"
"7125",120,"and you'll see it wrote there."""
"7126",120,""
"7127",120,"""Ah, Merry,"" remarked Silver, ""standing for cap'n again? You're a"
"7128",120,"pushing lad, to be sure."""
"7129",120,""
"7130",120,"But this time everyone was entirely in Merry's favour. They began to"
"7131",120,"scramble out of the excavation, darting furious glances behind them. One"
"7132",120,"thing I observed, which looked well for us: they all got out upon the"
"7133",120,"opposite side from Silver."
"7134",120,""
"7135",120,"Well, there we stood, two on one side, five on the other, the pit"
"7136",120,"between us, and nobody screwed up high enough to offer the first blow."
"7137",120,"Silver never moved; he watched them, very upright on his crutch, and"
"7138",120,"looked as cool as ever I saw him. He was brave, and no mistake."
"7139",120,""
"7140",120,"At last Merry seemed to think a speech might help matters."
"7141",120,""
"7142",120,"""Mates,"" says he, ""there's two of them alone there; one's the old"
"7143",120,"cripple that brought us all here and blundered us down to this; the"
"7144",120,"other's that cub that I mean to have the heart of. Now, mates--"""
"7145",120,""
"7146",120,"He was raising his arm and his voice, and plainly meant to lead a"
"7147",120,"charge. But just then--crack! crack! crack!--three musket-shots flashed"
"7148",120,"out of the thicket. Merry tumbled head foremost into the excavation; the"
"7149",120,"man with the bandage spun round like a teetotum and fell all his length"
"7150",120,"upon his side, where he lay dead, but still twitching; and the other"
"7151",120,"three turned and ran for it with all their might."
"7152",120,""
"7153",120,"Before you could wink, Long John had fired two barrels of a pistol into"
"7154",120,"the struggling Merry, and as the man rolled up his eyes at him in the"
"7155",120,"last agony, ""George,"" said he, ""I reckon I settled you."""
"7156",120,""
"7157",120,"At the same moment, the doctor, Gray, and Ben Gunn joined us, with"
"7158",120,"smoking muskets, from among the nutmeg-trees."
"7159",120,""
"7160",120,"""Forward!"" cried the doctor. ""Double quick, my lads. We must head 'em"
"7161",120,"off the boats."""
"7162",120,""
"7163",120,"And we set off at a great pace, sometimes plunging through the bushes to"
"7164",120,"the chest."
"7165",120,""
"7166",120,"I tell you, but Silver was anxious to keep up with us. The work that man"
"7167",120,"went through, leaping on his crutch till the muscles of his chest were"
"7168",120,"fit to burst, was work no sound man ever equalled; and so thinks the"
"7169",120,"doctor. As it was, he was already thirty yards behind us and on the"
"7170",120,"verge of strangling when we reached the brow of the slope."
"7171",120,""
"7172",120,"""Doctor,"" he hailed, ""see there! No hurry!"""
"7173",120,""
"7174",120,"Sure enough there was no hurry. In a more open part of the plateau, we"
"7175",120,"could see the three survivors still running in the same direction as"
"7176",120,"they had started, right for Mizzenmast Hill. We were already between"
"7177",120,"them and the boats; and so we four sat down to breathe, while Long John,"
"7178",120,"mopping his face, came slowly up with us."
"7179",120,""
"7180",120,"""Thank ye kindly, doctor,"" says he. ""You came in in about the nick, I"
"7181",120,"guess, for me and Hawkins. And so it's you, Ben Gunn!"" he added. ""Well,"
"7182",120,"you're a nice one, to be sure."""
"7183",120,""
"7184",120,"""I'm Ben Gunn, I am,"" replied the maroon, wriggling like an eel in his"
"7185",120,"embarrassment. ""And,"" he added, after a long pause, ""how do, Mr. Silver?"
"7186",120,"Pretty well, I thank ye, says you."""
"7187",120,""
"7188",120,"""Ben, Ben,"" murmured Silver, ""to think as you've done me!"""
"7189",120,""
"7190",120,"The doctor sent back Gray for one of the pick-axes deserted, in their"
"7191",120,"flight, by the mutineers, and then as we proceeded leisurely downhill to"
"7192",120,"where the boats were lying, related in a few words what had taken place."
"7193",120,"It was a story that profoundly interested Silver; and Ben Gunn, the"
"7194",120,"half-idiot maroon, was the hero from beginning to end."
"7195",120,""
"7196",120,"Ben, in his long, lonely wanderings about the island, had found the"
"7197",120,"skeleton--it was he that had rifled it; he had found the treasure; he"
"7198",120,"had dug it up (it was the haft of his pick-axe that lay broken in the"
"7199",120,"excavation); he had carried it on his back, in many weary journeys, from"
"7200",120,"the foot of the tall pine to a cave he had on the two-pointed hill at"
"7201",120,"the north-east angle of the island, and there it had lain stored in"
"7202",120,"safety since two months before the arrival of the HISPANIOLA."
"7203",120,""
"7204",120,"When the doctor had wormed this secret from him on the afternoon of the"
"7205",120,"attack, and when next morning he saw the anchorage deserted, he had gone"
"7206",120,"to Silver, given him the chart, which was now useless--given him the"
"7207",120,"stores, for Ben Gunn's cave was well supplied with goats' meat salted"
"7208",120,"by himself--given anything and everything to get a chance of moving in"
"7209",120,"safety from the stockade to the two-pointed hill, there to be clear of"
"7210",120,"malaria and keep a guard upon the money."
"7211",120,""
"7212",120,"""As for you, Jim,"" he said, ""it went against my heart, but I did what I"
"7213",120,"thought best for those who had stood by their duty; and if you were not"
"7214",120,"one of these, whose fault was it?"""
"7215",120,""
"7216",120,"That morning, finding that I was to be involved in the horrid"
"7217",120,"disappointment he had prepared for the mutineers, he had run all the way"
"7218",120,"to the cave, and leaving the squire to guard the captain, had taken Gray"
"7219",120,"and the maroon and started, making the diagonal across the island to be"
"7220",120,"at hand beside the pine. Soon, however, he saw that our party had the"
"7221",120,"start of him; and Ben Gunn, being fleet of foot, had been dispatched in"
"7222",120,"front to do his best alone. Then it had occurred to him to work upon the"
"7223",120,"superstitions of his former shipmates, and he was so far successful that"
"7224",120,"Gray and the doctor had come up and were already ambushed before the"
"7225",120,"arrival of the treasure-hunters."
"7226",120,""
"7227",120,"""Ah,"" said Silver, ""it were fortunate for me that I had Hawkins here."
"7228",120,"You would have let old John be cut to bits, and never given it a"
"7229",120,"thought, doctor."""
"7230",120,""
"7231",120,"""Not a thought,"" replied Dr. Livesey cheerily."
"7232",120,""
"7233",120,"And by this time we had reached the gigs. The doctor, with the pick-axe,"
"7234",120,"demolished one of them, and then we all got aboard the other and set out"
"7235",120,"to go round by sea for North Inlet."
"7236",120,""
"7237",120,"This was a run of eight or nine miles. Silver, though he was almost"
"7238",120,"killed already with fatigue, was set to an oar, like the rest of us, and"
"7239",120,"we were soon skimming swiftly over a smooth sea. Soon we passed out"
"7240",120,"of the straits and doubled the south-east corner of the island, round"
"7241",120,"which, four days ago, we had towed the HISPANIOLA."
"7242",120,""
"7243",120,"As we passed the two-pointed hill, we could see the black mouth of Ben"
"7244",120,"Gunn's cave and a figure standing by it, leaning on a musket. It was the"
"7245",120,"squire, and we waved a handkerchief and gave him three cheers, in which"
"7246",120,"the voice of Silver joined as heartily as any."
"7247",120,""
"7248",120,"Three miles farther, just inside the mouth of North Inlet, what should"
"7249",120,"we meet but the HISPANIOLA, cruising by herself? The last flood had"
"7250",120,"lifted her, and had there been much wind or a strong tide current, as"
"7251",120,"in the southern anchorage, we should never have found her more, or found"
"7252",120,"her stranded beyond help. As it was, there was little amiss beyond the"
"7253",120,"wreck of the main-sail. Another anchor was got ready and dropped in a"
"7254",120,"fathom and a half of water. We all pulled round again to Rum Cove,"
"7255",120,"the nearest point for Ben Gunn's treasure-house; and then Gray,"
"7256",120,"single-handed, returned with the gig to the HISPANIOLA, where he was to"
"7257",120,"pass the night on guard."
"7258",120,""
"7259",120,"A gentle slope ran up from the beach to the entrance of the cave. At the"
"7260",120,"top, the squire met us. To me he was cordial and kind, saying nothing"
"7261",120,"of my escapade either in the way of blame or praise. At Silver's polite"
"7262",120,"salute he somewhat flushed."
"7263",120,""
"7264",120,"""John Silver,"" he said, ""you're a prodigious villain and imposter--a"
"7265",120,"monstrous imposter, sir. I am told I am not to prosecute you. Well,"
"7266",120,"then, I will not. But the dead men, sir, hang about your neck like"
"7267",120,"mill-stones."""
"7268",120,""
"7269",120,"""Thank you kindly, sir,"" replied Long John, again saluting."

"7271",120,"""I dare you to thank me!"" cried the squire. ""It is a gross dereliction"
"7272",120,"of my duty. Stand back."""
"7273",120,""
"7274",120,"And thereupon we all entered the cave. It was a large, airy place, with"
"7275",120,"a little spring and a pool of clear water, overhung with ferns. The"
"7276",120,"floor was sand. Before a big fire lay Captain Smollett; and in a far"
"7277",120,"corner, only duskily flickered over by the blaze, I beheld great heaps"
"7278",120,"of coin and quadrilaterals built of bars of gold. That was Flint's"
"7279",120,"treasure that we had come so far to seek and that had cost already the"
"7280",120,"lives of seventeen men from the HISPANIOLA. How many it had cost in the"
"7281",120,"amassing, what blood and sorrow, what good ships scuttled on the deep,"
"7282",120,"what brave men walking the plank blindfold, what shot of cannon, what"
"7283",120,"shame and lies and cruelty, perhaps no man alive could tell. Yet there"
"7284",120,"were still three upon that island--Silver, and old Morgan, and Ben"
"7285",120,"Gunn--who had each taken his share in these crimes, as each had hoped in"
"7286",120,"vain to share in the reward."
"7287",120,""
"7288",120,"""Come in, Jim,"" said the captain. ""You're a good boy in your line, Jim,"
"7289",120,"but I don't think you and me'll go to sea again. You're too much of the"
"7290",120,"born favourite for me. Is that you, John Silver? What brings you here,"
"7291",120,"man?"""
"7292",120,""
"7293",120,"""Come back to my dooty, sir,"" returned Silver."
"7294",120,""
"7295",120,"""Ah!"" said the captain, and that was all he said."
"7296",120,""
"7297",120,"What a supper I had of it that night, with all my friends around me; and"
"7298",120,"what a meal it was, with Ben Gunn's salted goat and some delicacies and"
"7299",120,"a bottle of old wine from the HISPANIOLA. Never, I am sure, were people"
"7300",120,"gayer or happier. And there was Silver, sitting back almost out of the"
"7301",120,"firelight, but eating heartily, prompt to spring forward when anything"
"7302",120,"was wanted, even joining quietly in our laughter--the same bland,"
"7303",120,"polite, obsequious seaman of the voyage out."
"7304",120,""
"7305",120,""
"7306",120,""

"7308",120,"34"
"7309",120,""
"7310",120,"And Last"
"7311",120,""
"7312",120,"THE next morning we fell early to work, for the transportation of this"
"7313",120,"great mass of gold near a mile by land to the beach, and thence three"
"7314",120,"miles by boat to the HISPANIOLA, was a considerable task for so small"
"7315",120,"a number of workmen. The three fellows still abroad upon the island did"
"7316",120,"not greatly trouble us; a single sentry on the shoulder of the hill was"
"7317",120,"sufficient to ensure us against any sudden onslaught, and we thought,"
"7318",120,"besides, they had had more than enough of fighting."
"7319",120,""
"7320",120,"Therefore the work was pushed on briskly. Gray and Ben Gunn came and"
"7321",120,"went with the boat, while the rest during their absences piled treasure"
"7322",120,"on the beach. Two of the bars, slung in a rope's end, made a good load"
"7323",120,"for a grown man--one that he was glad to walk slowly with. For my part,"
"7324",120,"as I was not much use at carrying, I was kept busy all day in the cave"
"7325",120,"packing the minted money into bread-bags."
"7326",120,""
"7327",120,"It was a strange collection, like Billy Bones's hoard for the diversity"
"7328",120,"of coinage, but so much larger and so much more varied that I think I"
"7329",120,"never had more pleasure than in sorting them. English, French, Spanish,"
"7330",120,"Portuguese, Georges, and Louises, doubloons and double guineas and"
"7331",120,"moidores and sequins, the pictures of all the kings of Europe for the"
"7332",120,"last hundred years, strange Oriental pieces stamped with what looked"
"7333",120,"like wisps of string or bits of spider's web, round pieces and square"
"7334",120,"pieces, and pieces bored through the middle, as if to wear them round"
"7335",120,"your neck--nearly every variety of money in the world must, I think,"
"7336",120,"have found a place in that collection; and for number, I am sure they"
"7337",120,"were like autumn leaves, so that my back ached with stooping and my"
"7338",120,"fingers with sorting them out."
"7339",120,""
"7340",120,"Day after day this work went on; by every evening a fortune had been"
"7341",120,"stowed aboard, but there was another fortune waiting for the morrow; and"
"7342",120,"all this time we heard nothing of the three surviving mutineers."
"7343",120,""
"7344",120,"At last--I think it was on the third night--the doctor and I were"
"7345",120,"strolling on the shoulder of the hill where it overlooks the lowlands of"
"7346",120,"the isle, when, from out the thick darkness below, the wind brought us"
"7347",120,"a noise between shrieking and singing. It was only a snatch that reached"
"7348",120,"our ears, followed by the former silence."
"7349",120,""
"7350",120,"""Heaven forgive them,"" said the doctor; ""'tis the mutineers!"""
"7351",120,""
"7352",120,"""All drunk, sir,"" struck in the voice of Silver from behind us."
"7353",120,""
"7354",120,"Silver, I should say, was allowed his entire liberty, and in spite of"
"7355",120,"daily rebuffs, seemed to regard himself once more as quite a privileged"
"7356",120,"and friendly dependent. Indeed, it was remarkable how well he bore"
"7357",120,"these slights and with what unwearying politeness he kept on trying to"
"7358",120,"ingratiate himself with all. Yet, I think, none treated him better than"
"7359",120,"a dog, unless it was Ben Gunn, who was still terribly afraid of his old"
"7360",120,"quartermaster, or myself, who had really something to thank him for;"
"7361",120,"although for that matter, I suppose, I had reason to think even worse of"
"7362",120,"him than anybody else, for I had seen him meditating a fresh treachery"
"7363",120,"upon the plateau. Accordingly, it was pretty gruffly that the doctor"
"7364",120,"answered him."
"7365",120,""
"7366",120,"""Drunk or raving,"" said he."
"7367",120,""
"7368",120,"""Right you were, sir,"" replied Silver; ""and precious little odds which,"
"7369",120,"to you and me."""
"7370",120,""
"7371",120,"""I suppose you would hardly ask me to call you a humane man,"" returned"
"7372",120,"the doctor with a sneer, ""and so my feelings may surprise you, Master"
"7373",120,"Silver. But if I were sure they were raving--as I am morally certain"
"7374",120,"one, at least, of them is down with fever--I should leave this camp,"
"7375",120,"and at whatever risk to my own carcass, take them the assistance of my"
"7376",120,"skill."""
"7377",120,""
"7378",120,"""Ask your pardon, sir, you would be very wrong,"" quoth Silver. ""You"
"7379",120,"would lose your precious life, and you may lay to that. I'm on your side"
"7380",120,"now, hand and glove; and I shouldn't wish for to see the party weakened,"
"7381",120,"let alone yourself, seeing as I know what I owes you. But these men down"
"7382",120,"there, they couldn't keep their word--no, not supposing they wished to;"
"7383",120,"and what's more, they couldn't believe as you could."""
"7384",120,""
"7385",120,"""No,"" said the doctor. ""You're the man to keep your word, we know that."""
"7386",120,""
"7387",120,"Well, that was about the last news we had of the three pirates. Only"
"7388",120,"once we heard a gunshot a great way off and supposed them to be hunting."
"7389",120,"A council was held, and it was decided that we must desert them on the"
"7390",120,"island--to the huge glee, I must say, of Ben Gunn, and with the strong"
"7391",120,"approval of Gray. We left a good stock of powder and shot, the bulk"
"7392",120,"of the salt goat, a few medicines, and some other necessaries, tools,"
"7393",120,"clothing, a spare sail, a fathom or two of rope, and by the particular"
"7394",120,"desire of the doctor, a handsome present of tobacco."
"7395",120,""
"7396",120,"That was about our last doing on the island. Before that, we had got the"
"7397",120,"treasure stowed and had shipped enough water and the remainder of the"
"7398",120,"goat meat in case of any distress; and at last, one fine morning, we"
"7399",120,"weighed anchor, which was about all that we could manage, and stood out"
"7400",120,"of North Inlet, the same colours flying that the captain had flown and"
"7401",120,"fought under at the palisade."
"7402",120,""
"7403",120,"The three fellows must have been watching us closer than we thought for,"
"7404",120,"as we soon had proved. For coming through the narrows, we had to"
"7405",120,"lie very near the southern point, and there we saw all three of"
"7406",120,"them kneeling together on a spit of sand, with their arms raised in"
"7407",120,"supplication. It went to all our hearts, I think, to leave them in that"
"7408",120,"wretched state; but we could not risk another mutiny; and to take them"
"7409",120,"home for the gibbet would have been a cruel sort of kindness. The doctor"
"7410",120,"hailed them and told them of the stores we had left, and where they were"
"7411",120,"to find them. But they continued to call us by name and appeal to us,"
"7412",120,"for God's sake, to be merciful and not leave them to die in such a"
"7413",120,"place."
"7414",120,""
"7415",120,"At last, seeing the ship still bore on her course and was now swiftly"
"7416",120,"drawing out of earshot, one of them--I know not which it was--leapt to"
"7417",120,"his feet with a hoarse cry, whipped his musket to his shoulder, and sent"
"7418",120,"a shot whistling over Silver's head and through the main-sail."
"7419",120,""
"7420",120,"After that, we kept under cover of the bulwarks, and when next I looked"
"7421",120,"out they had disappeared from the spit, and the spit itself had almost"
"7422",120,"melted out of sight in the growing distance. That was, at least, the end"
"7423",120,"of that; and before noon, to my inexpressible joy, the highest rock of"
"7424",120,"Treasure Island had sunk into the blue round of sea."
"7425",120,""
"7426",120,"We were so short of men that everyone on board had to bear a hand--only"
"7427",120,"the captain lying on a mattress in the stern and giving his orders, for"
"7428",120,"though greatly recovered he was still in want of quiet. We laid her"
"7429",120,"head for the nearest port in Spanish America, for we could not risk the"
"7430",120,"voyage home without fresh hands; and as it was, what with baffling winds"
"7431",120,"and a couple of fresh gales, we were all worn out before we reached it."
"7432",120,""
"7433",120,"It was just at sundown when we cast anchor in a most beautiful"
"7434",120,"land-locked gulf, and were immediately surrounded by shore boats full"
"7435",120,"of Negroes and Mexican Indians and half-bloods selling fruits and"
"7436",120,"vegetables and offering to dive for bits of money. The sight of so many"
"7437",120,"good-humoured faces (especially the blacks), the taste of the tropical"
"7438",120,"fruits, and above all the lights that began to shine in the town made a"
"7439",120,"most charming contrast to our dark and bloody sojourn on the island;"
"7440",120,"and the doctor and the squire, taking me along with them, went ashore"
"7441",120,"to pass the early part of the night. Here they met the captain of an"
"7442",120,"English man-of-war, fell in talk with him, went on board his ship, and,"
"7443",120,"in short, had so agreeable a time that day was breaking when we came"
"7444",120,"alongside the HISPANIOLA."
"7445",120,""
"7446",120,"Ben Gunn was on deck alone, and as soon as we came on board he began,"
"7447",120,"with wonderful contortions, to make us a confession. Silver was gone."
"7448",120,"The maroon had connived at his escape in a shore boat some hours ago,"
"7449",120,"and he now assured us he had only done so to preserve our lives, which"
"7450",120,"would certainly have been forfeit if ""that man with the one leg"
"7451",120,"had stayed aboard."" But this was not all. The sea-cook had not gone"
"7452",120,"empty-handed. He had cut through a bulkhead unobserved and had removed"
"7453",120,"one of the sacks of coin, worth perhaps three or four hundred guineas,"
"7454",120,"to help him on his further wanderings."
"7455",120,""
"7456",120,"I think we were all pleased to be so cheaply quit of him."
"7457",120,""
"7458",120,"Well, to make a long story short, we got a few hands on board, made a"
"7459",120,"good cruise home, and the HISPANIOLA reached Bristol just as Mr. Blandly"
"7460",120,"was beginning to think of fitting out her consort. Five men only of"
"7461",120,"those who had sailed returned with her. ""Drink and the devil had done"
"7462",120,"for the rest,"" with a vengeance, although, to be sure, we were not quite"
"7463",120,"in so bad a case as that other ship they sang about:"
"7464",120,""
"7465",120,"     With one man of her crew alive,"
"7466",120,"     What put to sea with seventy-five."
"7467",120,""
"7468",120,"All of us had an ample share of the treasure and used it wisely or"
"7469",120,"foolishly, according to our natures. Captain Smollett is now retired"
"7470",120,"from the sea. Gray not only saved his money, but being suddenly smit"
"7471",120,"with the desire to rise, also studied his profession, and he is now"
"7472",120,"mate and part owner of a fine full-rigged ship, married besides, and the"
"7473",120,"father of a family. As for Ben Gunn, he got a thousand pounds, which he"
"7474",120,"spent or lost in three weeks, or to be more exact, in nineteen days, for"
"7475",120,"he was back begging on the twentieth. Then he was given a lodge to keep,"
"7476",120,"exactly as he had feared upon the island; and he still lives, a great"
"7477",120,"favourite, though something of a butt, with the country boys, and a"
"7478",120,"notable singer in church on Sundays and saints' days."
"7479",120,""
"7480",120,"Of Silver we have heard no more. That formidable seafaring man with one"
"7481",120,"leg has at last gone clean out of my life; but I dare say he met his old"
"7482",120,"Negress, and perhaps still lives in comfort with her and Captain Flint."
"7483",120,"It is to be hoped so, I suppose, for his chances of comfort in another"
"7484",120,"world are very small."
"7485",120,""
"7486",120,"The bar silver and the arms still lie, for all that I know, where"
"7487",120,"Flint buried them; and certainly they shall lie there for me. Oxen and"
"7488",120,"wain-ropes would not bring me back again to that accursed island; and"
"7489",120,"the worst dreams that ever I have are when I hear the surf booming about"
"7490",120,"its coasts or start upright in bed with the sharp voice of Captain Flint"
"7491",120,"still ringing in my ears: ""Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight!"""
