"43",55,""
"44",55,"Folklore, legends, myths and fairy tales have followed childhood"
"45",55,"through the ages, for every healthy youngster has a wholesome and"
"46",55,"instinctive love for stories fantastic, marvelous and manifestly"
"47",55,"unreal.  The winged fairies of Grimm and Andersen have brought more"
"48",55,"happiness to childish hearts than all other human creations."
"49",55,""
"50",55,"Yet the old time fairy tale, having served for generations, may now be"
"51",55,"classed as ""historical"" in the children's library; for the time has"
"52",55,"come for a series of newer ""wonder tales"" in which the stereotyped"
"53",55,"genie, dwarf and fairy are eliminated, together with all the horrible"
"54",55,"and blood-curdling incidents devised by their authors to point a"
"55",55,"fearsome moral to each tale.  Modern education includes morality;"
"56",55,"therefore the modern child seeks only entertainment in its wonder tales"
"57",55,"and gladly dispenses with all disagreeable incident."
"58",55,""
"59",55,"Having this thought in mind, the story of ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"""
"60",55,"was written solely to please children of today.  It aspires to being a"
"61",55,"modernized fairy tale, in which the wonderment and joy are retained and"
"62",55,"the heartaches and nightmares are left out."

"77",55,"1.  The Cyclone"
"78",55,""
"79",55,""
"80",55,"Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with Uncle"
"81",55,"Henry, who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmer's wife.  Their"
"82",55,"house was small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon"
"83",55,"many miles.  There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one"
"84",55,"room; and this room contained a rusty looking cookstove, a cupboard for"
"85",55,"the dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the beds.  Uncle Henry"
"86",55,"and Aunt Em had a big bed in one corner, and Dorothy a little bed in"
"87",55,"another corner.  There was no garret at all, and no cellar--except a"
"88",55,"small hole dug in the ground, called a cyclone cellar, where the family"
"89",55,"could go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose, mighty enough to"
"90",55,"crush any building in its path.  It was reached by a trap door in the"
"91",55,"middle of the floor, from which a ladder led down into the small, dark"
"92",55,"hole."
"93",55,""
"94",55,"When Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see"
"95",55,"nothing but the great gray prairie on every side.  Not a tree nor a"
"96",55,"house broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached to the edge of"
"97",55,"the sky in all directions.  The sun had baked the plowed land into a"
"98",55,"gray mass, with little cracks running through it.  Even the grass was"
"99",55,"not green, for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until"
"100",55,"they were the same gray color to be seen everywhere.  Once the house"
"101",55,"had been painted, but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed"
"102",55,"it away, and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else."
"103",55,""
"104",55,"When Aunt Em came there to live she was a young, pretty wife.  The sun"
"105",55,"and wind had changed her, too.  They had taken the sparkle from her"
"106",55,"eyes and left them a sober gray; they had taken the red from her cheeks"
"107",55,"and lips, and they were gray also.  She was thin and gaunt, and never"
"108",55,"smiled now.  When Dorothy, who was an orphan, first came to her, Aunt"
"109",55,"Em had been so startled by the child's laughter that she would scream"
"110",55,"and press her hand upon her heart whenever Dorothy's merry voice"
"111",55,"reached her ears; and she still looked at the little girl with wonder"
"112",55,"that she could find anything to laugh at."
"113",55,""
"114",55,"Uncle Henry never laughed.  He worked hard from morning till night and"
"115",55,"did not know what joy was.  He was gray also, from his long beard to"
"116",55,"his rough boots, and he looked stern and solemn, and rarely spoke."
"117",55,""
"118",55,"It was Toto that made Dorothy laugh, and saved her from growing as gray"
"119",55,"as her other surroundings.  Toto was not gray; he was a little black"
"120",55,"dog, with long silky hair and small black eyes that twinkled merrily on"
"121",55,"either side of his funny, wee nose.  Toto played all day long, and"
"122",55,"Dorothy played with him, and loved him dearly."
"123",55,""
"124",55,"Today, however, they were not playing.  Uncle Henry sat upon the"
"125",55,"doorstep and looked anxiously at the sky, which was even grayer than"
"126",55,"usual.  Dorothy stood in the door with Toto in her arms, and looked at"
"127",55,"the sky too.  Aunt Em was washing the dishes."
"128",55,""
"129",55,"From the far north they heard a low wail of the wind, and Uncle Henry"
"130",55,"and Dorothy could see where the long grass bowed in waves before the"
"131",55,"coming storm.  There now came a sharp whistling in the air from the"
"132",55,"south, and as they turned their eyes that way they saw ripples in the"
"133",55,"grass coming from that direction also."
"134",55,""
"135",55,"Suddenly Uncle Henry stood up."
"136",55,""
"137",55,"""There's a cyclone coming, Em,"" he called to his wife.  ""I'll go look"
"138",55,"after the stock.""  Then he ran toward the sheds where the cows and"
"139",55,"horses were kept."
"140",55,""
"141",55,"Aunt Em dropped her work and came to the door.  One glance told her of"
"142",55,"the danger close at hand."
"143",55,""
"144",55,"""Quick, Dorothy!"" she screamed.  ""Run for the cellar!"""
"145",55,""
"146",55,"Toto jumped out of Dorothy's arms and hid under the bed, and the girl"
"147",55,"started to get him.  Aunt Em, badly frightened, threw open the trap"
"148",55,"door in the floor and climbed down the ladder into the small, dark"
"149",55,"hole.  Dorothy caught Toto at last and started to follow her aunt."
"150",55,"When she was halfway across the room there came a great shriek from the"
"151",55,"wind, and the house shook so hard that she lost her footing and sat"
"152",55,"down suddenly upon the floor."
"153",55,""
"154",55,"Then a strange thing happened."
"155",55,""
"156",55,"The house whirled around two or three times and rose slowly through the"
"157",55,"air.  Dorothy felt as if she were going up in a balloon."
"158",55,""
"159",55,"The north and south winds met where the house stood, and made it the"
"160",55,"exact center of the cyclone.  In the middle of a cyclone the air is"
"161",55,"generally still, but the great pressure of the wind on every side of"
"162",55,"the house raised it up higher and higher, until it was at the very top"
"163",55,"of the cyclone; and there it remained and was carried miles and miles"
"164",55,"away as easily as you could carry a feather."
"165",55,""
"166",55,"It was very dark, and the wind howled horribly around her, but Dorothy"
"167",55,"found she was riding quite easily.  After the first few whirls around,"
"168",55,"and one other time when the house tipped badly, she felt as if she were"
"169",55,"being rocked gently, like a baby in a cradle."
"170",55,""
"171",55,"Toto did not like it.  He ran about the room, now here, now there,"
"172",55,"barking loudly; but Dorothy sat quite still on the floor and waited to"
"173",55,"see what would happen."
"174",55,""
"175",55,"Once Toto got too near the open trap door, and fell in; and at first"
"176",55,"the little girl thought she had lost him.  But soon she saw one of his"
"177",55,"ears sticking up through the hole, for the strong pressure of the air"
"178",55,"was keeping him up so that he could not fall.  She crept to the hole,"
"179",55,"caught Toto by the ear, and dragged him into the room again, afterward"
"180",55,"closing the trap door so that no more accidents could happen."
"181",55,""
"182",55,"Hour after hour passed away, and slowly Dorothy got over her fright;"
"183",55,"but she felt quite lonely, and the wind shrieked so loudly all about"
"184",55,"her that she nearly became deaf.  At first she had wondered if she"
"185",55,"would be dashed to pieces when the house fell again; but as the hours"
"186",55,"passed and nothing terrible happened, she stopped worrying and resolved"
"187",55,"to wait calmly and see what the future would bring.  At last she"
"188",55,"crawled over the swaying floor to her bed, and lay down upon it; and"
"189",55,"Toto followed and lay down beside her."
"190",55,""
"191",55,"In spite of the swaying of the house and the wailing of the wind,"
"192",55,"Dorothy soon closed her eyes and fell fast asleep."
"193",55,""
"194",55,""
"195",55,""
"196",55,""
"197",55,"2.  The Council with the Munchkins"
"198",55,""
"199",55,""
"200",55,"She was awakened by a shock, so sudden and severe that if Dorothy had"
"201",55,"not been lying on the soft bed she might have been hurt.  As it was,"
"202",55,"the jar made her catch her breath and wonder what had happened; and"
"203",55,"Toto put his cold little nose into her face and whined dismally."
"204",55,"Dorothy sat up and noticed that the house was not moving; nor was it"
"205",55,"dark, for the bright sunshine came in at the window, flooding the"
"206",55,"little room.  She sprang from her bed and with Toto at her heels ran"
"207",55,"and opened the door."
"208",55,""
"209",55,"The little girl gave a cry of amazement and looked about her, her eyes"
"210",55,"growing bigger and bigger at the wonderful sights she saw."
"211",55,""
"212",55,"The cyclone had set the house down very gently--for a cyclone--in the"
"213",55,"midst of a country of marvelous beauty.  There were lovely patches of"
"214",55,"greensward all about, with stately trees bearing rich and luscious"
"215",55,"fruits.  Banks of gorgeous flowers were on every hand, and birds with"
"216",55,"rare and brilliant plumage sang and fluttered in the trees and bushes."
"217",55,"A little way off was a small brook, rushing and sparkling along between"
"218",55,"green banks, and murmuring in a voice very grateful to a little girl"
"219",55,"who had lived so long on the dry, gray prairies."
"220",55,""
"221",55,"While she stood looking eagerly at the strange and beautiful sights,"
"222",55,"she noticed coming toward her a group of the queerest people she had"
"223",55,"ever seen.  They were not as big as the grown folk she had always been"
"224",55,"used to; but neither were they very small.  In fact, they seemed about"
"225",55,"as tall as Dorothy, who was a well-grown child for her age, although"
"226",55,"they were, so far as looks go, many years older."
"227",55,""
"228",55,"Three were men and one a woman, and all were oddly dressed.  They wore"
"229",55,"round hats that rose to a small point a foot above their heads, with"
"230",55,"little bells around the brims that tinkled sweetly as they moved.  The"
"231",55,"hats of the men were blue; the little woman's hat was white, and she"
"232",55,"wore a white gown that hung in pleats from her shoulders.  Over it were"
"233",55,"sprinkled little stars that glistened in the sun like diamonds.  The"
"234",55,"men were dressed in blue, of the same shade as their hats, and wore"
"235",55,"well-polished boots with a deep roll of blue at the tops.  The men,"
"236",55,"Dorothy thought, were about as old as Uncle Henry, for two of them had"
"237",55,"beards.  But the little woman was doubtless much older.  Her face was"
"238",55,"covered with wrinkles, her hair was nearly white, and she walked rather"
"239",55,"stiffly."
"240",55,""
"241",55,"When these people drew near the house where Dorothy was standing in the"
"242",55,"doorway, they paused and whispered among themselves, as if afraid to"
"243",55,"come farther.  But the little old woman walked up to Dorothy, made a"
"244",55,"low bow and said, in a sweet voice:"
"245",55,""
"246",55,"""You are welcome, most noble Sorceress, to the land of the Munchkins."
"247",55,"We are so grateful to you for having killed the Wicked Witch of the"
"248",55,"East, and for setting our people free from bondage."""
"249",55,""
"250",55,"Dorothy listened to this speech with wonder.  What could the little"
"251",55,"woman possibly mean by calling her a sorceress, and saying she had"
"252",55,"killed the Wicked Witch of the East?  Dorothy was an innocent, harmless"
"253",55,"little girl, who had been carried by a cyclone many miles from home;"
"254",55,"and she had never killed anything in all her life."
"255",55,""
"256",55,"But the little woman evidently expected her to answer; so Dorothy said,"
"257",55,"with hesitation, ""You are very kind, but there must be some mistake.  I"
"258",55,"have not killed anything."""
"259",55,""
"260",55,"""Your house did, anyway,"" replied the little old woman, with a laugh,"
"261",55,"""and that is the same thing.  See!"" she continued, pointing to the"
"262",55,"corner of the house.  ""There are her two feet, still sticking out from"
"263",55,"under a block of wood."""
"264",55,""
"265",55,"Dorothy looked, and gave a little cry of fright.  There, indeed, just"
"266",55,"under the corner of the great beam the house rested on, two feet were"
"267",55,"sticking out, shod in silver shoes with pointed toes."
"268",55,""
"269",55,"""Oh, dear!  Oh, dear!"" cried Dorothy, clasping her hands together in"
"270",55,"dismay.  ""The house must have fallen on her.  Whatever shall we do?"""
"271",55,""
"272",55,"""There is nothing to be done,"" said the little woman calmly."
"273",55,""
"274",55,"""But who was she?"" asked Dorothy."
"275",55,""
"276",55,"""She was the Wicked Witch of the East, as I said,"" answered the little"
"277",55,"woman.  ""She has held all the Munchkins in bondage for many years,"
"278",55,"making them slave for her night and day.  Now they are all set free,"
"279",55,"and are grateful to you for the favor."""
"280",55,""
"281",55,"""Who are the Munchkins?"" inquired Dorothy."
"282",55,""
"283",55,"""They are the people who live in this land of the East"
"284",55," where the Wicked Witch ruled."""
"285",55,""
"286",55,"""Are you a Munchkin?"" asked Dorothy."
"287",55,""
"288",55,"""No, but I am their friend, although I live in the land of the North."
"289",55,"When they saw the Witch of the East was dead the Munchkins sent a swift"
"290",55,"messenger to me, and I came at once.  I am the Witch of the North."""
"291",55,""
"292",55,"""Oh, gracious!"" cried Dorothy.  ""Are you a real witch?"""
"293",55,""
"294",55,"""Yes, indeed,"" answered the little woman.  ""But I am a good witch, and"
"295",55,"the people love me.  I am not as powerful as the Wicked Witch was who"
"296",55,"ruled here, or I should have set the people free myself."""
"297",55,""
"298",55,"""But I thought all witches were wicked,"" said the girl, who was half"
"299",55,"frightened at facing a real witch.  ""Oh, no, that is a great mistake."
"300",55,"There were only four witches in all the Land of Oz, and two of them,"
"301",55,"those who live in the North and the South, are good witches.  I know"
"302",55,"this is true, for I am one of them myself, and cannot be mistaken."
"303",55,"Those who dwelt in the East and the West were, indeed, wicked witches;"
"304",55,"but now that you have killed one of them, there is but one Wicked Witch"
"305",55,"in all the Land of Oz--the one who lives in the West."""
"306",55,""
"307",55,"""But,"" said Dorothy, after a moment's thought, ""Aunt Em has told me"
"308",55,"that the witches were all dead--years and years ago."""
"309",55,""
"310",55,"""Who is Aunt Em?"" inquired the little old woman."
"311",55,""
"312",55,"""She is my aunt who lives in Kansas, where I came from."""
"313",55,""
"314",55,"The Witch of the North seemed to think for a time, with her head bowed"
"315",55,"and her eyes upon the ground.  Then she looked up and said, ""I do not"
"316",55,"know where Kansas is, for I have never heard that country mentioned"
"317",55,"before.  But tell me, is it a civilized country?"""
"318",55,""
"319",55,"""Oh, yes,"" replied Dorothy."
"320",55,""
"321",55,"""Then that accounts for it.  In the civilized countries I believe there"
"322",55,"are no witches left, nor wizards, nor sorceresses, nor magicians.  But,"
"323",55,"you see, the Land of Oz has never been civilized, for we are cut off"
"324",55,"from all the rest of the world.  Therefore we still have witches and"
"325",55,"wizards amongst us."""
"326",55,""
"327",55,"""Who are the wizards?"" asked Dorothy."
"328",55,""
"329",55,"""Oz himself is the Great Wizard,"" answered the Witch, sinking her voice"
"330",55,"to a whisper.  ""He is more powerful than all the rest of us together."
"331",55,"He lives in the City of Emeralds."""
"332",55,""
"333",55,"Dorothy was going to ask another question, but just then the Munchkins,"
"334",55,"who had been standing silently by, gave a loud shout and pointed to the"
"335",55,"corner of the house where the Wicked Witch had been lying."
"336",55,""
"337",55,"""What is it?"" asked the little old woman, and looked, and began to"
"338",55,"laugh.  The feet of the dead Witch had disappeared entirely, and"
"339",55,"nothing was left but the silver shoes."
"340",55,""
"341",55,"""She was so old,"" explained the Witch of the North, ""that she dried up"
"342",55,"quickly in the sun.  That is the end of her.  But the silver shoes are"
"343",55,"yours, and you shall have them to wear."" She reached down and picked up"
"344",55,"the shoes, and after shaking the dust out of them handed them to"
"345",55,"Dorothy."
"346",55,""
"347",55,"""The Witch of the East was proud of those silver shoes,"" said one of"
"348",55,"the Munchkins, ""and there is some charm connected with them; but what"
"349",55,"it is we never knew."""
"350",55,""
"351",55,"Dorothy carried the shoes into the house and placed them on the table."
"352",55,"Then she came out again to the Munchkins and said:"
"353",55,""
"354",55,"""I am anxious to get back to my aunt and uncle, for I am sure they will"
"355",55,"worry about me.  Can you help me find my way?"""
"356",55,""
"357",55,"The Munchkins and the Witch first looked at one another, and then at"
"358",55,"Dorothy, and then shook their heads."
"359",55,""
"360",55,"""At the East, not far from here,"" said one, ""there is a great desert,"
"361",55,"and none could live to cross it."""
"362",55,""
"363",55,"""It is the same at the South,"" said another, ""for I have been there and"
"364",55,"seen it.  The South is the country of the Quadlings."""
"365",55,""
"366",55,"""I am told,"" said the third man, ""that it is the same at the West.  And"
"367",55,"that country, where the Winkies live, is ruled by the Wicked Witch of"
"368",55,"the West, who would make you her slave if you passed her way."""
"369",55,""
"370",55,"""The North is my home,"" said the old lady, ""and at its edge is the same"
"371",55,"great desert that surrounds this Land of Oz.  I'm afraid, my dear, you"
"372",55,"will have to live with us."""
"373",55,""
"374",55,"Dorothy began to sob at this, for she felt lonely among all these"
"375",55,"strange people.  Her tears seemed to grieve the kind-hearted Munchkins,"
"376",55,"for they immediately took out their handkerchiefs and began to weep"
"377",55,"also.  As for the little old woman, she took off her cap and balanced"
"378",55,"the point on the end of her nose, while she counted ""One, two, three"""
"379",55,"in a solemn voice.  At once the cap changed to a slate, on which was"
"380",55,"written in big, white chalk marks:"
"381",55,""
"382",55,""
"383",55," ""LET DOROTHY GO TO THE CITY OF EMERALDS"""

"984",55,""
"985",55,"""I was born the son of a woodman who chopped down trees in the forest"
"986",55,"and sold the wood for a living.  When I grew up, I too became a"
"987",55,"woodchopper, and after my father died I took care of my old mother as"
"988",55,"long as she lived.  Then I made up my mind that instead of living alone"
"989",55,"I would marry, so that I might not become lonely."
"990",55,""
"991",55,"""There was one of the Munchkin girls who was so beautiful that I soon"
"992",55,"grew to love her with all my heart.  She, on her part, promised to"
"993",55,"marry me as soon as I could earn enough money to build a better house"
"994",55,"for her; so I set to work harder than ever.  But the girl lived with an"
"995",55,"old woman who did not want her to marry anyone, for she was so lazy she"
"996",55,"wished the girl to remain with her and do the cooking and the"
"997",55,"housework.  So the old woman went to the Wicked Witch of the East, and"
"998",55,"promised her two sheep and a cow if she would prevent the marriage."
"999",55,"Thereupon the Wicked Witch enchanted my axe, and when I was chopping"
"1000",55,"away at my best one day, for I was anxious to get the new house and my"
"1001",55,"wife as soon as possible, the axe slipped all at once and cut off my"
"1002",55,"left leg."
"1003",55,""
"1004",55,"""This at first seemed a great misfortune, for I knew a one-legged man"
"1005",55,"could not do very well as a wood-chopper.  So I went to a tinsmith and"
"1006",55,"had him make me a new leg out of tin.  The leg worked very well, once I"
"1007",55,"was used to it.  But my action angered the Wicked Witch of the East,"
"1008",55,"for she had promised the old woman I should not marry the pretty"
"1009",55,"Munchkin girl.  When I began chopping again, my axe slipped and cut off"
"1010",55,"my right leg.  Again I went to the tinsmith, and again he made me a leg"
"1011",55,"out of tin.  After this the enchanted axe cut off my arms, one after"
"1012",55,"the other; but, nothing daunted, I had them replaced with tin ones."
"1013",55,"The Wicked Witch then made the axe slip and cut off my head, and at"
"1014",55,"first I thought that was the end of me.  But the tinsmith happened to"
"1015",55,"come along, and he made me a new head out of tin."
"1016",55,""
"1017",55,"""I thought I had beaten the Wicked Witch then, and I worked harder than"
"1018",55,"ever; but I little knew how cruel my enemy could be.  She thought of a"
"1019",55,"new way to kill my love for the beautiful Munchkin maiden, and made my"
"1020",55,"axe slip again, so that it cut right through my body, splitting me into"
"1021",55,"two halves.  Once more the tinsmith came to my help and made me a body"
"1022",55,"of tin, fastening my tin arms and legs and head to it, by means of"
"1023",55,"joints, so that I could move around as well as ever.  But, alas!  I had"
"1024",55,"now no heart, so that I lost all my love for the Munchkin girl, and did"
"1025",55,"not care whether I married her or not.  I suppose she is still living"
"1026",55,"with the old woman, waiting for me to come after her."
"1027",55,""
"1028",55,"""My body shone so brightly in the sun that I felt very proud of it and"
"1029",55,"it did not matter now if my axe slipped, for it could not cut me."
"1030",55,"There was only one danger--that my joints would rust; but I kept an"
"1031",55,"oil-can in my cottage and took care to oil myself whenever I needed it."
"1032",55,"However, there came a day when I forgot to do this, and, being caught"
"1033",55,"in a rainstorm, before I thought of the danger my joints had rusted,"
"1034",55,"and I was left to stand in the woods until you came to help me.  It was"
"1035",55,"a terrible thing to undergo, but during the year I stood there I had"
"1036",55,"time to think that the greatest loss I had known was the loss of my"
"1037",55,"heart.  While I was in love I was the happiest man on earth; but no one"
"1038",55,"can love who has not a heart, and so I am resolved to ask Oz to give me"
"1039",55,"one.  If he does, I will go back to the Munchkin maiden and marry her."""

"1133",55,"""No,"" said Dorothy, ""he's made of tin.""  And she helped the Woodman up"
"1134",55,"again."

"1136",55,"""That's why he nearly blunted my claws,"" said the Lion.  ""When they"

"1140",55,"""He is my dog, Toto,"" answered Dorothy."

"1154",55,"All the other animals in the forest naturally expect me to be brave,"
"1155",55,"for the Lion is everywhere thought to be the King of Beasts.  I learned"
"1156",55,"that if I roared very loudly every living thing was frightened and got"
"1157",55,"out of my way.  Whenever I've met a man I've been awfully scared; but I"
"1158",55,"just roared at him, and he has always run away as fast as he could go."
"1159",55,"If the elephants and the tigers and the bears had ever tried to fight"

"1212",55,"So once more the little company set off upon the journey, the Lion"

"1214",55,"this new comrade at first, for he could not forget how nearly he had"
"1215",55,"been crushed between the Lion's great jaws.  But after a time he became"
"1216",55,"more at ease, and presently Toto and the Cowardly Lion had grown to be"

"1219",55,"During the rest of that day there was no other adventure to mar the"

"1221",55,"beetle that was crawling along the road, and killed the poor little"
"1222",55,"thing.  This made the Tin Woodman very unhappy, for he was always"
"1223",55,"careful not to hurt any living creature; and as he walked along he wept"
"1224",55,"several tears of sorrow and regret.  These tears ran slowly down his"
"1225",55,"face and over the hinges of his jaw, and there they rusted.  When"
"1226",55,"Dorothy presently asked him a question the Tin Woodman could not open"
"1227",55,"his mouth, for his jaws were tightly rusted together.  He became"
"1228",55,"greatly frightened at this and made many motions to Dorothy to relieve"
"1229",55,"him, but she could not understand.  The Lion was also puzzled to know"
"1230",55,"what was wrong.  But the Scarecrow seized the oil-can from Dorothy's"
"1231",55,"basket and oiled the Woodman's jaws, so that after a few moments he"
"1232",55,"could talk as well as before."

"1239",55,"when he saw a tiny ant toiling by he would step over it, so as not to"
"1240",55,"harm it.  The Tin Woodman knew very well he had no heart, and therefore"

"1253",55,"They were obliged to camp out that night under a large tree in the"
"1254",55,"forest, for there were no houses near.  The tree made a good, thick"
"1255",55,"covering to protect them from the dew, and the Tin Woodman chopped a"
"1256",55,"great pile of wood with his axe and Dorothy built a splendid fire that"
"1257",55,"warmed her and made her feel less lonely.  She and Toto ate the last of"
"1258",55,"their bread, and now she did not know what they would do for breakfast."

"1268",55,"But the Lion went away into the forest and found his own supper, and no"

"1270",55,"found a tree full of nuts and filled Dorothy's basket with them, so"
"1271",55,"that she would not be hungry for a long time.  She thought this was"
"1272",55,"very kind and thoughtful of the Scarecrow, but she laughed heartily at"
"1273",55,"the awkward way in which the poor creature picked up the nuts.  His"
"1274",55,"padded hands were so clumsy and the nuts were so small that he dropped"
"1275",55,"almost as many as he put in the basket.  But the Scarecrow did not mind"
"1276",55,"how long it took him to fill the basket, for it enabled him to keep"
"1277",55,"away from the fire, as he feared a spark might get into his straw and"
"1278",55,"burn him up.  So he kept a good distance away from the flames, and only"
"1279",55,"came near to cover Dorothy with dry leaves when she lay down to sleep."
"1280",55,"These kept her very snug and warm, and she slept soundly until morning."

"1285",55,"This was to be an eventful day for the travelers.  They had hardly been"

"1288",55,"side.  It was a very wide ditch, and when they crept up to the edge and"
"1289",55,"looked into it they could see it was also very deep, and there were"
"1290",55,"many big, jagged rocks at the bottom.  The sides were so steep that"
"1291",55,"none of them could climb down, and for a moment it seemed that their"

"1336",55,"then they all sat down for a few moments to give the beast a chance to"
"1337",55,"rest, for his great leaps had made his breath short, and he panted like"
"1338",55,"a big dog that has been running too long."
"1339",55,""
"1340",55,"They found the forest very thick on this side, and it looked dark and"
"1341",55,"gloomy.  After the Lion had rested they started along the road of"
"1342",55,"yellow brick, silently wondering, each in his own mind, if ever they"
"1343",55,"would come to the end of the woods and reach the bright sunshine again."
"1344",55,"To add to their discomfort, they soon heard strange noises in the"
"1345",55,"depths of the forest, and the Lion whispered to them that it was in"
"1346",55,"this part of the country that the Kalidahs lived."

"1372",55,"The Woodman set to work at once, and so sharp was his axe that the tree"
"1373",55,"was soon chopped nearly through.  Then the Lion put his strong front"
"1374",55,"legs against the tree and pushed with all his might, and slowly the big"
"1375",55,"tree tipped and fell with a crash across the ditch, with its top"
"1376",55,"branches on the other side."

"1378",55,"They had just started to cross this queer bridge when a sharp growl"

"1389",55,"and terrible a roar that Dorothy screamed and the Scarecrow fell over"
"1390",55,"backward, while even the fierce beasts stopped short and looked at him"
"1391",55,"in surprise."
"1392",55,""
"1393",55,"But, seeing they were bigger than the Lion, and remembering that there"
"1394",55,"were two of them and only one of him, the Kalidahs again rushed"
"1395",55,"forward, and the Lion crossed over the tree and turned to see what they"
"1396",55,"would do next.  Without stopping an instant the fierce beasts also"
"1397",55,"began to cross the tree.  And the Lion said to Dorothy:"

"1404",55,"best to be done, and now he asked the Woodman to chop away the end of"
"1405",55,"the tree that rested on their side of the ditch.  The Tin Woodman began"
"1406",55,"to use his axe at once, and, just as the two Kalidahs were nearly"
"1407",55,"across, the tree fell with a crash into the gulf, carrying the ugly,"
"1408",55,"snarling brutes with it, and both were dashed to pieces on the sharp"
"1409",55,"rocks at the bottom."

"1421",55,"thinner the farther they advanced, and in the afternoon they suddenly"
"1422",55,"came upon a broad river, flowing swiftly just before them.  On the"
"1423",55,"other side of the water they could see the road of yellow brick running"

"1515",55,""
"1516",55,"They were all tired out when they reached the shore at last and stepped"

"1519",55,"Emerald City."
"1520",55,""

"1685",55,"great yellow Wildcat, and the Woodman thought it must be chasing"
"1686",55,"something, for its ears were lying close to its head and its mouth was"
"1687",55,"wide open, showing two rows of ugly teeth, while its red eyes glowed"
"1688",55,"like balls of fire.  As it came nearer the Tin Woodman saw that running"

"1836",55,"After this they sat down beside the Lion until he should awaken; and"

"1846",55,"It was some time before the Cowardly Lion awakened, for he had lain"
"1847",55,"among the poppies a long while, breathing in their deadly fragrance;"
"1848",55,"but when he did open his eyes and roll off the truck he was very glad"
"1849",55,"to find himself still alive."
"1850",55,""
"1851",55,"""I ran as fast as I could,"" he said, sitting down and yawning, ""but the"
"1852",55,"flowers were too strong for me.  How did you get me out?"""
"1853",55,""
"1854",55,"Then they told him of the field mice, and how they had generously saved"
"1855",55,"him from death; and the Cowardly Lion laughed, and said:"
"1856",55,""
"1857",55,"""I have always thought myself very big and terrible; yet such little"
"1858",55,"things as flowers came near to killing me, and such small animals as"

"1860",55,"shall we do now?"""

"1869",55,"Great Oz dwelt."
"1870",55,""
"1871",55,"The road was smooth and well paved, now, and the country about was"
"1872",55,"beautiful, so that the travelers rejoiced in leaving the forest far"
"1873",55,"behind, and with it the many dangers they had met in its gloomy shades."
"1874",55,"Once more they could see fences built beside the road; but these were"
"1875",55,"painted green, and when they came to a small house, in which a farmer"
"1876",55,"evidently lived, that also was painted green.  They passed by several"
"1877",55,"of these houses during the afternoon, and sometimes people came to the"
"1878",55,"doors and looked at them as if they would like to ask questions; but no"
"1879",55,"one came near them nor spoke to them because of the great Lion, of"
"1880",55,"which they were very much afraid.  The people were all dressed in"
"1881",55,"clothing of a lovely emerald-green color and wore peaked hats like"
"1882",55,"those of the Munchkins."

"1887",55,"""Yes,"" answered the Scarecrow.  ""Everything is green here, while in the"
"1888",55,"country of the Munchkins blue was the favorite color.  But the people"

"1895",55,""
"1896",55,"So, when they came to a good-sized farmhouse, Dorothy walked boldly up"
"1897",55,"to the door and knocked."
"1898",55,""
"1899",55,"A woman opened it just far enough to look out, and said, ""What do you"

"1917",55,"couch in a corner.  They seemed greatly surprised to see so strange a"
"1918",55,"company, and while the woman was busy laying the table the man asked:"

"1931",55,"nor do I know of any living person who has seen him."""
"1932",55,""
"1933",55,"""Does he never go out?"" asked the Scarecrow."

"1935",55,"""Never.  He sits day after day in the great Throne Room of his Palace,"
"1936",55,"and even those who wait upon him do not see him face to face."""

"1938",55,"""What is he like?"" asked the girl."
"1939",55,""
"1940",55,"""That is hard to tell,"" said the man thoughtfully.  ""You see, Oz is a"

"1942",55,"looks like a bird; and some say he looks like an elephant; and some say"
"1943",55,"he looks like a cat.  To others he appears as a beautiful fairy, or a"
"1944",55,"brownie, or in any other form that pleases him.  But who the real Oz"
"1945",55,"is, when he is in his own form, no living person can tell."""

"1974",55,""
"1975",55,"""Very likely.  Well, Oz can do anything; so I suppose he will find"
"1976",55,"Kansas for you.  But first you must get to see him, and that will be a"

"1978",55,"usually has his own way.  But what do YOU want?"" he continued, speaking"
"1979",55,"to Toto.  Toto only wagged his tail; for, strange to say, he could not"

"1982",55,"The woman now called to them that supper was ready, so they gathered"

"1985",55,"The Lion ate some of the porridge, but did not care for it, saying it"
"1986",55,"was made from oats and oats were food for horses, not for lions.  The"
"1987",55,"Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman ate nothing at all.  Toto ate a little of"

"2003",55,"City.  It was high and thick and of a bright green color."
"2004",55,""
"2005",55,"In front of them, and at the end of the road of yellow brick, was a big"

"2027",55,"shaking his head in perplexity.  ""He is powerful and terrible, and if"
"2028",55,"you come on an idle or foolish errand to bother the wise reflections of"

"2033",55,"Wizard."""
"2034",55,""
"2035",55,"""So he is,"" said the green man, ""and he rules the Emerald City wisely"
"2036",55,"and well.  But to those who are not honest, or who approach him from"
"2037",55,"curiosity, he is most terrible, and few have ever dared ask to see his"
"2038",55,"face.  I am the Guardian of the Gates, and since you demand to see the"
"2039",55,"Great Oz I must take you to his Palace.  But first you must put on the"
"2040",55,"spectacles."""

"2046",55,"wear spectacles night and day.  They are all locked on, for Oz so"
"2047",55,"ordered it when the City was first built, and I have the only key that"

"2049",55,""
"2050",55,"He opened the big box, and Dorothy saw that it was filled with"

"2053",55,"Dorothy and put them over her eyes.  There were two golden bands"
"2054",55,"fastened to them that passed around the back of her head, where they"
"2055",55,"were locked together by a little key that was at the end of a chain the"
"2056",55,"Guardian of the Gates wore around his neck.  When they were on, Dorothy"
"2057",55,"could not take them off had she wished, but of course she did not wish"
"2058",55,"to be blinded by the glare of the Emerald City, so she said nothing."

"2078",55,"and studded everywhere with sparkling emeralds.  They walked over a"
"2079",55,"pavement of the same green marble, and where the blocks were joined"
"2080",55,"together were rows of emeralds, set closely, and glittering in the"
"2081",55,"brightness of the sun.  The window panes were of green glass; even the"
"2082",55,"sky above the City had a green tint, and the rays of the sun were green."
"2083",55,""
"2084",55,"There were many people--men, women, and children--walking about, and"

"2087",55,"eyes, and the children all ran away and hid behind their mothers when"
"2088",55,"they saw the Lion; but no one spoke to them.  Many shops stood in the"
"2089",55,"street, and Dorothy saw that everything in them was green.  Green candy"
"2090",55,"and green pop corn were offered for sale, as well as green shoes, green"
"2091",55,"hats, and green clothes of all sorts.  At one place a man was selling"
"2092",55,"green lemonade, and when the children bought it Dorothy could see that"
"2093",55,"they paid for it with green pennies."
"2094",55,""
"2095",55,"There seemed to be no horses nor animals of any kind; the men carried"

"2126",55,"enter his presence alone, and he will admit but one each day."
"2127",55,"Therefore, as you must remain in the Palace for several days, I will"

"2135",55,"green hair and green eyes, and she bowed low before Dorothy as she"
"2136",55,"said, ""Follow me and I will show you your room."""

"2141",55,"Palace.  It was the sweetest little room in the world, with a soft"
"2142",55,"comfortable bed that had sheets of green silk and a green velvet"
"2143",55,"counterpane.  There was a tiny fountain in the middle of the room, that"
"2144",55,"shot a spray of green perfume into the air, to fall back into a"
"2145",55,"beautifully carved green marble basin.  Beautiful green flowers stood"
"2146",55,"in the windows, and there was a shelf with a row of little green books."
"2147",55,"When Dorothy had time to open these books she found them full of queer"

"2160",55,"Scarecrow; for when he found himself alone in his room he stood"
"2161",55,"stupidly in one spot, just within the doorway, to wait till morning."
"2162",55,"It would not rest him to lie down, and he could not close his eyes; so"

"2166",55,"force of habit, for he remembered when he was made of flesh; but not"
"2167",55,"being able to sleep, he passed the night moving his joints up and down"

"2659",55,"order they were given.  But no person could command these strange"
"2660",55,"creatures more than three times.  Twice already the Wicked Witch had"
"2661",55,"used the charm of the Cap.  Once was when she had made the Winkies her"
"2662",55,"slaves, and set herself to rule over their country.  The Winged Monkeys"
"2663",55,"had helped her do this.  The second time was when she had fought"
"2664",55,"against the Great Oz himself, and driven him out of the land of the"
"2665",55,"West.  The Winged Monkeys had also helped her in doing this.  Only once"
"2666",55,"more could she use this Golden Cap, for which reason she did not like"
"2667",55,"to do so until all her other powers were exhausted.  But now that her"
"2668",55,"fierce wolves and her wild crows and her stinging bees were gone, and"
"2669",55,"her slaves had been scared away by the Cowardly Lion, she saw there was"
"2670",55,"only one way left to destroy Dorothy and her friends."
"2671",55,""
"2672",55,"So the Wicked Witch took the Golden Cap from her cupboard and placed it"

"2688",55,"the Wicked Witch surrounded by a crowd of monkeys, each with a pair of"
"2689",55,"immense and powerful wings on his shoulders."
"2690",55,""
"2691",55,"One, much bigger than the others, seemed to be their leader.  He flew"

"2706",55,"rocks, where he lay so battered and dented that he could neither move"
"2707",55,"nor groan."

"2709",55,"Others of the Monkeys caught the Scarecrow, and with their long fingers"
"2710",55,"pulled all of the straw out of his clothes and head.  They made his hat"
"2711",55,"and boots and clothes into a small bundle and threw it into the top"
"2712",55,"branches of a tall tree."
"2713",55,""
"2714",55,"The remaining Monkeys threw pieces of stout rope around the Lion and"
"2715",55,"wound many coils about his body and head and legs, until he was unable"
"2716",55,"to bite or scratch or struggle in any way.  Then they lifted him up and"
"2717",55,"flew away with him to the Witch's castle, where he was placed in a"
"2718",55,"small yard with a high iron fence around it, so that he could not"
"2719",55,"escape."
"2720",55,""

"2724",55,"long, hairy arms stretched out and his ugly face grinning terribly; but"
"2725",55,"he saw the mark of the Good Witch's kiss upon her forehead and stopped"
"2726",55,"short, motioning the others not to touch her."
"2727",55,""
"2728",55,"""We dare not harm this little girl,"" he said to them, ""for she is"

"2741",55,"Your power over our band is now ended, and you will never see us again."""
"2742",55,""
"2743",55,"Then all the Winged Monkeys, with much laughing and chattering and"
"2744",55,"noise, flew into the air and were soon out of sight."
"2745",55,""
"2746",55,"The Wicked Witch was both surprised and worried when she saw the mark"
"2747",55,"on Dorothy's forehead, for she knew well that neither the Winged"
"2748",55,"Monkeys nor she, herself, dare hurt the girl in any way.  She looked"
"2749",55,"down at Dorothy's feet, and seeing the Silver Shoes, began to tremble"
"2750",55,"with fear, for she knew what a powerful charm belonged to them.  At"
"2751",55,"first the Witch was tempted to run away from Dorothy; but she happened"
"2752",55,"to look into the child's eyes and saw how simple the soul behind them"
"2753",55,"was, and that the little girl did not know of the wonderful power the"
"2754",55,"Silver Shoes gave her.  So the Wicked Witch laughed to herself, and"
"2755",55,"thought, ""I can still make her my slave, for she does not know how to"
"2756",55,"use her power."" Then she said to Dorothy, harshly and severely:"
"2757",55,""
"2758",55,"""Come with me; and see that you mind everything I tell you, for if you"
"2759",55,"do not I will make an end of you, as I did of the Tin Woodman and the"
"2760",55,"Scarecrow."""
"2761",55,""
"2762",55,"Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle"
"2763",55,"until they came to the kitchen, where the Witch bade her clean the pots"
"2764",55,"and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood."
"2765",55,""
"2766",55,"Dorothy went to work meekly, with her mind made up to work as hard as"

"2769",55,""
"2770",55,"With Dorothy hard at work, the Witch thought she would go into the"
"2771",55,"courtyard and harness the Cowardly Lion like a horse; it would amuse"
"2772",55,"her, she was sure, to make him draw her chariot whenever she wished to"
"2773",55,"go to drive.  But as she opened the gate the Lion gave a loud roar and"
"2774",55,"bounded at her so fiercely that the Witch was afraid, and ran out and"
"2775",55,"shut the gate again."
"2776",55,""
"2777",55,"""If I cannot harness you,"" said the Witch to the Lion, speaking through"
"2778",55,"the bars of the gate, ""I can starve you.  You shall have nothing to eat"
"2779",55,"until you do as I wish."""
"2780",55,""
"2781",55,"So after that she took no food to the imprisoned Lion; but every day"
"2782",55,"she came to the gate at noon and asked, ""Are you ready to be harnessed"
"2783",55,"like a horse?"""
"2784",55,""

"2789",55,"every night, while the woman was asleep, Dorothy carried him food from"
"2790",55,"the cupboard.  After he had eaten he would lie down on his bed of"
"2791",55,"straw, and Dorothy would lie beside him and put her head on his soft,"
"2792",55,"shaggy mane, while they talked of their troubles and tried to plan some"
"2793",55,"way to escape.  But they could find no way to get out of the castle,"
"2794",55,"for it was constantly guarded by the yellow Winkies, who were the"
"2795",55,"slaves of the Wicked Witch and too afraid of her not to do as she told"
"2796",55,"them."
"2797",55,""
"2798",55,"The girl had to work hard during the day, and often the Witch"
"2799",55,"threatened to beat her with the same old umbrella she always carried in"
"2800",55,"her hand.  But, in truth, she did not dare to strike Dorothy, because"
"2801",55,"of the mark upon her forehead.  The child did not know this, and was"
"2802",55,"full of fear for herself and Toto.  Once the Witch struck Toto a blow"
"2803",55,"with her umbrella and the brave little dog flew at her and bit her leg"
"2804",55,"in return.  The Witch did not bleed where she was bitten, for she was"
"2805",55,"so wicked that the blood in her had dried up many years before."
"2806",55,""
"2807",55,"Dorothy's life became very sad as she grew to understand that it would"
"2808",55,"be harder than ever to get back to Kansas and Aunt Em again.  Sometimes"
"2809",55,"she would cry bitterly for hours, with Toto sitting at her feet and"
"2810",55,"looking into her face, whining dismally to show how sorry he was for"
"2811",55,"his little mistress.  Toto did not really care whether he was in Kansas"
"2812",55,"or the Land of Oz so long as Dorothy was with him; but he knew the"
"2813",55,"little girl was unhappy, and that made him unhappy too."
"2814",55,""
"2815",55,"Now the Wicked Witch had a great longing to have for her own the Silver"
"2816",55,"Shoes which the girl always wore.  Her bees and her crows and her"
"2817",55,"wolves were lying in heaps and drying up, and she had used up all the"
"2818",55,"power of the Golden Cap; but if she could only get hold of the Silver"
"2819",55,"Shoes, they would give her more power than all the other things she had"
"2820",55,"lost.  She watched Dorothy carefully, to see if she ever took off her"
"2821",55,"shoes, thinking she might steal them.  But the child was so proud of"
"2822",55,"her pretty shoes that she never took them off except at night and when"
"2823",55,"she took her bath.  The Witch was too much afraid of the dark to dare"
"2824",55,"go in Dorothy's room at night to take the shoes, and her dread of water"
"2825",55,"was greater than her fear of the dark, so she never came near when"
"2826",55,"Dorothy was bathing.  Indeed, the old Witch never touched water, nor"
"2827",55,"ever let water touch her in any way."
"2828",55,""
"2829",55,"But the wicked creature was very cunning, and she finally thought of a"
"2830",55,"trick that would give her what she wanted.  She placed a bar of iron in"
"2831",55,"the middle of the kitchen floor, and then by her magic arts made the"
"2832",55,"iron invisible to human eyes.  So that when Dorothy walked across the"
"2833",55,"floor she stumbled over the bar, not being able to see it, and fell at"
"2834",55,"full length.  She was not much hurt, but in her fall one of the Silver"
"2835",55,"Shoes came off; and before she could reach it, the Witch had snatched"
"2836",55,"it away and put it on her own skinny foot."
"2837",55,""
"2838",55,"The wicked woman was greatly pleased with the success of her trick, for"
"2839",55,"as long as she had one of the shoes she owned half the power of their"
"2840",55,"charm, and Dorothy could not use it against her, even had she known how"
"2841",55,"to do so."
"2842",55,""
"2843",55,"The little girl, seeing she had lost one of her pretty shoes, grew"
"2844",55,"angry, and said to the Witch, ""Give me back my shoe!"""

"2855",55,"This made Dorothy so very angry that she picked up the bucket of water"
"2856",55,"that stood near and dashed it over the Witch, wetting her from head to"
"2857",55,"foot."
"2858",55,""
"2859",55,"Instantly the wicked woman gave a loud cry of fear, and then, as"
"2860",55,"Dorothy looked at her in wonder, the Witch began to shrink and fall"
"2861",55,"away."

"2863",55,"""See what you have done!"" she screamed.  ""In a minute I shall melt"
"2864",55,"away."""

"2869",55,"""Didn't you know water would be the end of me?"" asked the Witch, in a"

"2884",55,"of the old woman, she cleaned and dried it with a cloth, and put it on"

"2917",55,"to do all in their power for Dorothy, who had set them free from"
"2918",55,"bondage.  So she chose a number of the Winkies who looked as if they"
"2919",55,"knew the most, and they all started away.  They traveled that day and"
"2920",55,"part of the next until they came to the rocky plain where the Tin"
"2921",55,"Woodman lay, all battered and bent.  His axe was near him, but the"

"2943",55,"and head of the Tin Woodman, until at last he was straightened out into"
"2944",55,"his old form, and his joints worked as well as ever.  To be sure, there"
"2945",55,"were several patches on him, but the tinsmiths did a good job, and as"

"2951",55,"joints would not be rusted.  At the same time her own tears fell thick"
"2952",55,"and fast at the joy of meeting her old friend again, and these tears"
"2953",55,"did not need to be wiped away.  As for the Lion, he wiped his eyes so"
"2954",55,"often with the tip of his tail that it became quite wet, and he was"
"2955",55,"obliged to go out into the courtyard and hold it in the sun till it"
